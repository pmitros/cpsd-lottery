# Immersion / World Language Programs
We decided to add a section on immersion programs because they are choices offered in the lottery.  You **cannot** be mandatory assigned to an immersion program, so if you like the idea of your child learning another language, find out more and make a decision.

There are three dual-immersion programs at Cambridge, where students learn both English and another language starting in kindergarten (usually about half day in each), see 
[official description](http://www.cpsd.us/departments/frc/waitlist_transfers/immersion_program)).

* **Amigos School** -  the whole school is Spanish Immersion
* **Chinese Immersion** - at Dr. MLK School. Note everyone at the school learns Chinese, besides Chinese Immersion, the rest of the school still gets 45 minutes a day  of Chinese as part of the Nihao program.
* **Ola Portuguese Immersion** - a program at King Open School. 

### Why Immersion 
* There are many benefits to dual immersion eduation, from [higher test scores to fewer behavior problems](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/11/29/497943749/6-potential-brain-benefits-of-bilingual-education).
* In today's global economy, knowing how to speak a another language increases future job opportunities. 

### FAQ about Immersion 
####Q. What if we don't speak that language at home?
You don’t need to know the language, in fact, most kids in immersion classes learn from scratch.

####Q. How do I help my kids with homework?
In the lower grades, there's typically no homework.  Starting 3rd grade, there is optional homework, which your child will usually be ready for.

####Q. Will my kids get behind on English?
See [here](https://www.education.com/magazine/article/language-immersion-program/), while your child might initially be a bit slower on learning English, they usually catch up by 2nd or 3rd grade, and often surpass those in regular programs in the upper grades.

### Lottery considerations: 
The immersion programs are **over-subscribed by high-income** (or paid lunch) families and **under-subscribed by low-income** (or free/reduced lunch) families. Given the programs must be balanced by social-economic status, this means your child will have a much better shot of getting in if they qualify for free/reduced lunch.  In fact, up until two years ago, the Chinese Immersion program usually had 6 spots open at the kindergarten level for low-income families.  Even now, in 1st grade and up, there are often seats held open for low-income families while there's a long waitlist for high-income families.

* Amigos and Chinese Immersion (MLK) both hard to get in if you're paid lunch. In the January 2018 lottery, there's almost no chance for your child to get into Chinese Immersion unless they have a sibling already at the school.

* Ola Portuguese Immersion is the easiest of the three to get in if you’re paid lunch.

* For free/reduced lunch families, you have a much better shot of getting into all the immersion programs. And even if the kindergarten is full, it's quite likely that in 1st grade and above spots will open up.  

* For determined paid lunch families, some do succeed in waiting out the waitlist. We know families that transferred in 1st, 2nd, or even 3rd grade, often with the help of a parent, a tutor, or weekend language programs.  We're not suggesting you do that, frankly we're amazed how determined some families are, and thought we should let everyone know the options, and let you decide.  Also, at the MLK School, in the third grade the Chinese immersion and non-immersion strands merge, so you can switch then as well.

### World Language Programs
There are also options for world language programs, where kids learn for less than an hour a day. 
* Spanish at FMA
* Spanish at Morse (4th grade)
* Spanish at Peabody (4th grade)
* Chinese at MLK

They are good options if you want some language program but don't care for fluency, or are unable to get into the immersion programs. Parents generally feel happy about the language exposure, but frustrated that because there are new kids joining the program every year or during the year, it's hard to build fluency as teachers have to ensure that the kids just starting out are able to keep up.
