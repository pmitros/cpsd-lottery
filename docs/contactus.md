[comment]: <> (This site is by parents for parents. A group of us CPS parents, having gone through the lottery, want to share learnings to make it easier for new parents. )

Our goal is to get all the information out there to help parents new to CPS to make an informed choice.  Given our source is other parents, we understand the information may be incomplete.  Our hope is that you'll let us know if this is the case. :)

#### A new parent to CPS?
Do you have questions that are not yet answered? please [let us know](mailto:becca@yana.com)! 

#### A current CPS parent?
We're currently looking for parents to talk to about all the schools. [Contact us](mailto:becca@yana.com) if you'd like to be interviewed about your school.
Or if you see something here that you disagree with or would like to quality further, also [let us know](mailto:becca@yana.com)!
