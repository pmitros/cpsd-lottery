## <a name="notes-stats"></a> How to interpret our statistics

Our statistics are based on a rough analysis of last years' data. The district provides such data such that parents may make informed choices. They vary from year-to-year, and this web site may lead to more than normal year-to-year differences. 

## <a name="notes-sip"></a> How to interpret a School Improvement Plan

A school improvement plan gives an insiders perspective into what a school prioritizes and what it views as key areas of focus. Be aware that these are written by school administrators for the central administration, and the goal of many a school principal is, first and foremost, to keep their job. Much of the language is coded. For example, if you see text like "Student proficiency in science increased last year with better alignment to curriculum," and "accountability on goals," that may mean the teachers may have been forced to follow Common Core Standards more closely -- in essence, teaching to the test rather than to their own or student interests. Individual statistics are usually less than helpful as well for very similar reasons.

What does come across clearly are priorities and planned methods for achiving those. Does the SIP talk about special needs students? About advanced learners? About art or music?

Standards are also helpful to look at; what are kids expected to know by grade 2? By grade 3?

## <a name="notes-tests"></a> How to interpret test scores

For the most part, ignore tests. Educational testing stops being meaningful once it is tied to high stakes, which the district has very much done. A large portion of what standardized tests measure is the degree to which teachers teach to the test. In some Massachusetts schools, half the year is spent on MCAS-prep. Those schools get very high test scores, but very little meaningful learning happens. Cambridge is quite a bit better in some schools and only a little bit better in others.

## <a name="notes-rumours"></a> Playground talk -- where do school reputations come from?

The district takes a very neutral stance on comparing schools. It doesn't want to play favorites. This stance leaves a vacuum of information. That gets filled with rumors which spread like wildfire. Many have basis in one of two facts:

* Population distribution and school distribution. For example, the Kendall/Harvard area has many schools, but not many children, so schools tend to be undersubscribed. North and West Cambridge has many children, but not as many schools, so schools tend to be oversubscribed. People perceive how competitive a school is to get into as a measure of quality.
* Test scores. Misusing test scores is especially easy now that there are web sites which give school rankings based on scores. See the above section about interpretting test scores for why using them to rate schools is a fallacy.

Many others are simply rumors. It's worth looking at specifics, but not at general impressions

## <a name="notes-community"></a> What to look for in community

*When a diverse group of parents, staff and students are involved together in the daily making of a school, in all aspects of the school's functioning, when they are respected, trusted, supported and empowered, than they will individually snd collectively own that school and will do everything in their power to make it a successful place for kids.*

Len Solo, former principal of Graham and Parks of about three decades, conducted a survey defines three levels of school community:

1. **Not Striving for Community**. "We have a very active PTA. Parents have been involved on various committees. We have a Lay Advisory committee from the community-at-large. We have activities such as two-day drug abuse workshops which involved students, teachers and parents with some sensitivity-type training."
2. **Half-Way Houses**. "We have attempted this through the use of small tutorial grous and weekly Town Meetings; both of these devices have encountered severe difficulties and rarely function well, thus far. They are about to be modified."
3. **Community**. People live and learn together. "*We try to create an atmosphere where openness and honesty and warmth predominate. We try to keep the decision-making process collective. The staff and volunteers understand that learning is not a one-way street, that sharing is most important and love is a meaningful word. The students respond in kind.*"

## <a name="notes-look-sip"></a> What to look for in schools

* All Cambridge schools tend to do pretty well for average kids. Where there are big difference is in how they handle outliers. Quite frankly, as precious as your child might seem, at this age, you have no idea what your child's long-term interests will be, whether they'll develop problems, what subjects they might be ahead in, and where they might be behind. Looking at how schools handle special needs kids, advanced learners, or English language learners is in many ways more telling than the typical classroom.
* Openness and community. Are parents in classrooms? Are they allowed in classrooms? Is the school like a community center with parents throwing activities in classrooms, or is there a closed door policy? The trick is to ask specific questions -- many parents don't have a perspective on other schools. Some will consider a strong community to be one with monthly events, while another might expect regular parent presence in classrooms.
* What's the curriculum like? This matters mostly from grade 3. There is a strong focus on MCAS passage in many schools so a common problem is that schools target average or below average students, have low standards, gaps for more advanced students, and a lack of emphasis on material not tested on the MCAS.
* Take a quick look at the upper schools as well, but understand that a half-decade is a long time. Schools may be completely different by the time your kids are there.

## <a name="notes-how-good"></a> How good are CPSD schools. Should I move/consider charters/consider private schools?

CPSD elementary schools are very good, especially in the lower grades! By most rankings, Massachusetts has the top school system in the nation. Cambridge schools are among the best in the state. There are school systems with much higher test scores, but for the most part, that's a question of demographics rather than school quality -- about a quarter to a third of CPSD students live in or near poverty, and CPSD handles many special needs students as well. CPSD spends $27,000 per student -- more than many private schools.

Not every school is a great fit for every family. Most parents switch schools if they find particular schools aren't working for their kids. There is no reason to do so preemptively; misfits are as likely to happen in one direction as in the other. 

CPSD upper schools have issues, but the district is working on them. It's very likely they'll be fixed by the time your kids get there.

## What are all the Kings?

The lottery has four options named after Dr. Martin Luther King, which is sometimes a little bit confusing. What's the history here? 

The Cambridge School District originally had just one school named after Martin Luther King. At the time, Graham and Parks was an extremely progressive, open, and oversubscribed school. Parents looking for a similar model opened up an open classroom pilot at the MLK school. For many years, the school had two programs: mainstream and King Open. Eventually, King Open split off into its own school, while MLK kept the more traditional education model (which it still follows today).

In 2011, another group of parents opened up an innovative Chinese Immersion program, again, within the MLK school. The school is again split into two tracks, with about 40% of students in the immersion track, and about 60% in the non-immersion track. Students from both tracks mix (and increasingly in higher grades, where the English half of the day becomes fully integrated). The immersion track tends to be **extremely** oversubscribed. There are expected to be no spots available for children without siblings already in the program in the 2018 lottery. The mainstream track, most parents who try can get it on.

King Open also has a highly-regarded Portuguese language immersion track -- Ola! -- which is quite a bit older. We're not quite sure of the history of how it was founded. 

So on the [school lottery](/#lottery) sheet, you will see four different choices in schools named after Dr. King. Make sure you pick the right one!
