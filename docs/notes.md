## How to interpret a School Improvement Plan

A school improvement plan gives an insiders perspective into what a school prioritizes and what it views as key areas of focus. Be aware that these are written by school administrators for the central administration. The goal of many a school principal is, first and foremost, to keep their job. The statistics given are less than helpful, and much of the language is coded. Much is learned by what is omitted. For example, if you see text like "Student proficiency in science increased last year with better alignment to curriculum," and "accountability on goals," that means the teachers may have been forced to follow Common Core Standards more closely -- in essence, teaching to the test rather than to their own or student interests.

## How to interpret test scores

For the most part, ignore them. Educational testing stops being meaningful once it is tied to high stakes. In essense, standardized tests measure both teaching quality *and* the degree to which teachers teach to the test. In some Massachusetts schools, half the year is spent on MCAS-prep. Those schools get very high test scores, but very little meaningful learning happens. Test scores are especially unimportant in the JK-2 grade range. Here, the goal is for kids to develop positive attitudes towards school and to learn to work in a structured group. What kids learn at this age is quite unimportant relative to that!

Standardized tests have a reasons for being there, but comparing schools isn't one of them.

## Playground talk -- where do school reputations come from?

The district takes a very neutral stance on comparing schools. It doesn't want to play favorites. This stance leaves a vacuum of information. That gets filled with rumors which spread like wildfire. Many have basis in one of two facts:

* Population distribution and school distribution. For example, the Kendall/Harvard area has many schools, but not many children, so schools tend to be undersubscribed. North and West Cambridge has many children, but not as many schools, so schools tend to be oversubscribed. People perceive how competitive a school is to get into as a measure of quality.
* Test scores. Misusing test scores is especially easy now that there are web sites which give school rankings based on scores. See the above section about interpretting test scores for why using them to rate schools is a fallacy.

Many others are simply rumors. We set up this web site to counter a lot of that playground talk. 

## What to look for in community

## What to look for in schools

* All Cambridge schools tend to do pretty well for average kids. Where there are big difference is in how they handle outliers. Quite frankly, as precious as your child might seem, at this age, you have no idea what your child's long-term interests will be, whether they'll develop problems, what subjects they might be ahead in, and where they might be behind. Looking at how schools handle special needs kids, advanced learners, or English language learners is in many ways more telling than the typical classroom.
* Openness and community. Are parents in classrooms? Are they allowed in classrooms? Is the school like a community center with parents throwing activities in classrooms, or is there a closed door policy? The trick is to ask specific questions -- many parents don't have a perspective on other schools. Some will consider a strong community to be one with monthly events, while another might expect regular parent presence in classrooms.
* What's the curriculum like? This matters mostly from grade 3. There is a strong focus on MCAS passage in many schools, so a common problem is that schools target average or below average students, and have gaps for more advanced students.
* Take a quick look at the upper schools as well, but understand that a half-decade is a long time. Schools may be completely different by the time your kids are there.

## How good are CPSD schools. Should I move/consider charters/consider private schools?

CPSD elementary schools are very good, especially in the lower grades! By most rankings, Massachusetts has the top school system in the nation. Cambridge schools are among the best in the state. There are school systems with much higher test scores, but for the most part, that's a question of demographics rather than school quality -- about a quarter to a third of CPSD students live in or near poverty, and CPSD handles many special needs students as well. CPSD spends $27,000 per student -- more than many private schools.

Not every school is a great fit for every family. Most parents switch schools if they find particular schools aren't working for their kids. There is no reason to do so preemptively; misfits are as likely to happen in one direction as in the other. 

CPSD upper schools have issues, but the district is working on them. It's very likely they'll be fixed by the time your kids get there.
