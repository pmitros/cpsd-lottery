# What's next

Congratulations! You're about to enter a wonderful school district. As next steps:

* Look into deadlines for afterschool programs. Many are first-come-first-served.
* Sign up for the [CPS Parents](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/cpsparents/info) mailing list
* Sign up on [Yana](http://yana.com/) to communicate with parents at your own school
* Sign up for the [Cambridge School Committe Listserv](http://www.cpsd.us/cms/One.aspx?portalId=3042869&pageId=3769699). Occasionally motions come up which might *really* affect your students
* Vote in the municipal elections, and help others vote as well. Your childrens' education depends on it. Without parents voting, school elections will be dominated by unions, affinity voters with no vested interest in the schools, and special interests.
