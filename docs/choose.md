# How to choose a school
First, a [very good guide](http://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/Migration/Reflections_on_the_Kindergarten_Lottery.pdf?rev=0) from a fellow parent debunking myths around **“playground talk”** reputation or **test scores**. 

Here are some of our suggestions:

* **No need to stress.** Most parents are very happy with whichever school they end up with, and all the schools are quite good.  But do take the time to learn about the schools. 
* Start with **[proximity schools](http://cpsd.us/departments/frc/proximity_map_finder)**.  There are many good reasons for doing so:

    * Your child would be happy to know other kids in the **neighborhood**, for playdates (now) and hang out with (later).  Many parents who send their kids across town complain that their kids lack playmates. 

    * You can often **walk your child** to school.  Good exercise and less reliance on the bus.

    * For some parents **proximity is their #1** reason for picking a school.

    * You're more likely to spend more time at school and get to know **what’s going on**.  One of the biggest complaints new CPS parents have is that they no longer get daily reports (like from preschools) about their kids, and feel disconnected from what's going on at schools. That's worse for parents who rely on the buses, and don't come into school.

    * You might also get to know more of the **other parents.**  (Some of my best friends now are parents from our schools.)

* Look at further schools which feel like **a better fit**

    * Many kids like taking the bus.  

    * You can make friends with other parents from the bus stop.  

    * The other schools are not that far away. Many parents volunteer at a non-neighborhood school and make friends there.

* There is no one best school: **different schools** fit  different kids and families.  Some of the other ways parents tend to choose schools:

    * Working adults should consider **afterschool options**. Considering visiting; at schools with early start times, your child might spend almost as much time in afterschool as in school, and the options differ at least as much as schools themselves.

    * Specialty programs: e.g.  [language/immersion](/#language), Montessori, Kodaly music, etc.

    * How they deal with **special needs**, from advanced learners to dyslexia to autism.

    * Warmth of the school, strength of the community, philosophy of teaching.

* More considerations for proximity and **school bus**:

    * Schools start at **different times**, from 7:55 to 8:55.  Do they work for your logistics? Will kids get [enough sleep](https://www.cdc.gov/features/school-start-times/index.html)? 

    * Check [bus eligibility](http://www.cpsd.us/cms/One.aspx?portalId=3042869&pageId=3407666) & [routes](https://ewa.edulogweb.com/cambridgema1web/webquery/) too, as well as before-school and after-school options to get a better idea of realistic hours. 

    * If your child has to take a school bus to get to school, note you'll often need to get to the bus stop early.  An 8 am start time might be 7 am bus pickup to drive across Cambridge and give time for breakfast in the school cafeteria! 

    * If you are in an after school program or community school, the bus will take your child from your school to a program in a different location, but there is **no busing** from the afterschool programs.  So be sure you have an afterschool option near you if you depend on busing.

    * Some schools have options for earlier drop off.  If that's important to you, the bus won't get you there for that.

    * Parents with kids in the upper schools tell us: it's terrific when a child can walk to their upper school all on their own for all three years--very empowering for them and great exercise too (and saves you time.)


* Last but probably most important: **visit the schools!**

    * Schedule **school tours** for schools you’re interested in. 
    
    * Many parents have changed their mind after actually visiting a school.


### What to do on a school tour

* See how classrooms are managed. Do students look actively **engaged?** Are they doing things? 

* See if there are **parents** or other community members in the school (especially helping out in classrooms).
  That shows family engagement by the school.

* Look for **diversity**: students learn better when there’s a variety of them.  And are they integrated or do kids segregate?

* See how well the school does for students a little outside of the mainstream. Almost all Cambridge schools target the median student well. Talk to teachers about what they do if students are ahead or behind (esp. a few grade levels difference).

* Look at **grades 3-5**. There are much bigger differences between schools as kids get older. Briefly look at upper schools too but realize things may change completely in the next six years.

### How good are CPSD schools? Should I worry? 

CPSD is among the best school districts in the nation. All of the schools in the system are very good. Are they perfect? Of course not; CPSD has a number of substantial issues which we can go into. We hope that you get involved and help surface and address some of those issues. But on the whole, any school in CPSD is far better than any school most of us had growing up. Picking between schools in CPSD is like picking between a Porsche, a Tesla, a Rolls-Royce limo, a Prius, and a BMW SUV. Are there better and worse choices? Indubitably. It's worth educating yourself about the schools and the differences. But there aren't any bad choices. And at the end of the day, kids are quite resilient. Many do extremely well after schools much worse than CPSD.

Let's get a few things out-of-the-way: Most parents and kids are very happy where they end up. CPSD spends 2-3x the state and national averages on a per-student basis, and on-par with many private schools. The school district is very good, especially in the early grades and in high school.

### Should I consider private schools or charters? 

Massachusetts has among the best public schools in the nation, and among the best charters. It's certainly worth a look. 

As for private schools, unless you're independently wealthy, it's probably not worth the money in the early grades. While JK-2 matter far more than higher grades for long-term outcomes, the key thing in the early years is developing positive attitudes towards school/learning and socioemotional development. Those are areas CPSD excels at. The key reason to transfer is if your child has special needs which your school does not meet well. Many schools in CPSD don't do as well with advanced learners, for certain types of disabilities, or kids who are otherwise a bit outside of the mainstream. 

Some parents also take their kids out for upper school (CPSD's term for middle schools). Some of the upper schools have significant issues (which is not uncommon in districts; puberty was a little tough for most of us too). However, the district is actively working to resolve these issues.  It's likely that by the time your kids hit the upper schools, the issues your kids will be facing will be completely different from those of the kids today :)
