# How to choose a school
First, a [good guide](http://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/Migration/Reflections_on_the_Kindergarten_Lottery.pdf?rev=0) from a fellow parent debunking myths around **“playground talk”** reputation or **test scores**. 

Here are some of our suggestions:

* **No need to stress,** most parents are very happy with whichever school they end up with. :) But do take the time to learn about the schools. 

* Start with **proximity schools**

    * Benefits of knowing other kids in your **neighborhood** for your kids to have playdates (now) and hang out with (later).

    * More likely to hang out at school and get to know what’s going on and the other parents.  (Some of my best friends now are parents from our schools.)

* There is no one best school: Different schools for different kids and families.

* Visit the schools!  Schedule **school tours** for schools you’re interested in.

* Specialty programs: e.g.  music, language, Montessori, etc.

#### What to do on a school tour

* See how classrooms are managed. Do students look actively **engaged?** Are they doing things? 

* See if there are **parents** or other community members in the school.
  That shows family engagement by the school.

* Look for **diversity**: students learn better when there’s a variety of them.  And whether integrated?

* See how well the school does for students a little outside of the mainstream. Almost all Cambridge schools target the median student well. Talk to teachers about what they do if students are ahead or behind.

* Look at **grades 3-5**. There are much bigger differences between schools as kids get older. Briefly look at middle schools too but realize things may change completely in the next six years.
