# How to choose a school
First, a [very good guide](http://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/Migration/Reflections_on_the_Kindergarten_Lottery.pdf?rev=0) from a fellow parent debunking myths around **“playground talk”** reputation or **test scores**. 

Here are some of our suggestions:

* **No need to stress.** most parents are very happy with whichever school they end up with. :) But do take the time to learn about the schools. 
* Start with **[proximity schools](http://cpsd.us/departments/frc/proximity_map_finder)**

    * Your child would be happy to know other kids in the **neighborhood**, for playdates (now) and hang out with (later).  Many parents who send their kids across town complain that their kids lack playmates. 

    * You can walk your child to school.  If your child has to take a **school bus** to get to school, note you'll often need to get to the bus stop early. (Even though we live a 10 minute ride away from school, we had to get to the bus 35 minutes earlier.)  Schools start at different times, from 7:55 to 8:55.  So work backwards to get a sense of how early you'll need to get your child ready every day if you're counting on the bus.

    * More likely to hang out at school and get to know what’s going on and the other parents.  (Some of my best friends now are parents from our schools.)

* There is no one best school: different schools fit  different kids and families.

* Visit the schools!  Schedule **school tours** for schools you’re interested in. 

* Specialty programs: e.g.  music, language, Montessori, etc.

### What to do on a school tour

* See how classrooms are managed. Do students look actively **engaged?** Are they doing things? 

* See if there are **parents** or other community members in the school (especially helping out in classrooms).
  That shows family engagement by the school.

* Look for **diversity**: students learn better when there’s a variety of them.  And are they integrated or do kids segregate?

* See how well the school does for students a little outside of the mainstream. Almost all Cambridge schools target the median student well. Talk to teachers about what they do if students are ahead or behind (esp. a few grade levels difference).

* Look at **grades 3-5**. There are much bigger differences between schools as kids get older. Briefly look at middle schools too but realize things may change completely in the next six years.

### How good are CPSD schools? Should I worry? 

CPSD is among the best school districts in the nation. All of the schools in the system are very good. Are they perfect? Of course not; CPSD has a number of substantive issues which we can go into. But on the whole, any school in CPSD is far better than any school most of us had growing up. Picking between schools in CPSD is like picking between a Porche, a Tesla, a Rolls-Royce limo, and a BMW SUV. Are there better and worse choices? Indubitably. It's worth educating yourself about the schools and the difference. But there aren't any bad choices. Kids are resilient and do well in schools much worse than CPSD.

Let's get a few things out-of-the-way: Most parents and kids are very happy where they end up. CPSD spends 2-3x the state and national averages on a per-student basis, and on-par with many private school. The school district is very good, especially in the early grades and in high school.

### Should I consider private schools or charters? 

Massachusetts has among the best school districts in the nation, and among the best charters. It's certainly worth a look. 

As for private schools, unless you're independently wealthy, it's probably not worth the money in the early grades. While JK-2 matter far more than higher grades for long term outcomes, the key thing in these years is developing positive attitudes towards school and learning and socioemotional development. These are areas CPSD excels at. The key reason to transfer is if your child has special needs which your school does not meet well. Many schools in CPSD don't do as well with advanced learners, certain types of disabilities, or kids who are otherwise a bit outside of the mainstream. 

Some parents also take their kids out for upper school (CPSD's term for middle schools). Some of the upper schools have significant issues (which is not uncommon in districts; puberty is a tough time). However, the district is actively working to resolve these issues.  It's likely that by the time your kids hit the upper schools, the issues will be completely different :)
