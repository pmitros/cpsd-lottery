# How to choose a school
First, a [very good guide](http://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/Migration/Reflections_on_the_Kindergarten_Lottery.pdf?rev=0) from a fellow parent debunking myths around **“playground talk”** reputation or **test scores**. 

Here are some of our suggestions:

* **No need to stress,** most parents are very happy with whichever school they end up with. :) But do take the time to learn about the schools. 

* Start with **[proximity schools](http://cpsd.us/departments/frc/proximity_map_finder)**
    * Benefits of knowing other kids in your **neighborhood** for your kids to have playdates (now) and hang out with (later).

    * You can walk your child to school.  If your child has to take a **school bus** to get to school, note you'll often need to get to the bus stop early. (Even though we live a 10 minute ride away from school, we had to get to the bus 35 minutes earlier.)  Schools start at different times, from 7:55 to 8:55.  So work backwards to get a sense of how early you'll need to get your child ready every day if you're counting on the bus.

    * More likely to hang out at school and get to know what’s going on and the other parents.  (Some of my best friends now are parents from our schools.)

* There is no one best school: different schools fit  different kids and families.

* Visit the schools!  Schedule **school tours** for schools you’re interested in. 

* Specialty programs: e.g.  music, language, Montessori, etc.

#### What to do on a school tour

* See how classrooms are managed. Do students look actively **engaged?** Are they doing things? 

* See if there are **parents** or other community members in the school (especially helping out in classrooms).
  That shows family engagement by the school.

* Look for **diversity**: students learn better when there’s a variety of them.  And are they integrated or do kids segregate?

* See how well the school does for students a little outside of the mainstream. Almost all Cambridge schools target the median student well. Talk to teachers about what they do if students are ahead or behind (esp. a few grade levels difference).

* Look at **grades 3-5**. There are much bigger differences between schools as kids get older. Briefly look at middle schools too but realize things may change completely in the next six years.
