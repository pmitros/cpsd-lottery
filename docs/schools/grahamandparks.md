Graham and Parks is perhaps the most famous elementary school in the system. It was founded in 1972 as an alternative, progressive school. It was one of the most successful progressive schools in the nation, and much of its genesis is described in the book [Making an Extraordinary School: The Work of Ordinary People](https://books.google.com/books?id=pRaaGNcrvaIC). It was the first magnet school in the district, affirmatively bringing in kids from all parts of Cambridge, all ethnicities, and all socioeconomic brackets. The school was run by a council of parents and teachers (the principal had one vote, just like everybody else). Learning was personalized to the interest of individual students. It rejected standardization, and focused on educating the entire student to act as a good member of the community.

The school district underwent [a standardization effort](http://www.nonpartisaneducation.org/Review/Testimonials/v10n2.htm) in the early 2000's, so only some aspects of the founding model remain.

## General

### What do most parents say they like the most about Graham and Parks?

* It's a good school community. That's not unique to our school by any means, but it's a very welcoming community. Families are warm, inviting, and eager to get to know other families and be helpful.
* Truly, truly diverse. The sheltered English immersion program contributes to that, but even in non-SEI classes, by every measure -- cultural, race, ethnicity, religion, language -- there's no majority population. Parents like being in Cambridge because of the diversity.

### Are most families from the neighborhood or spread throughout Cambridge?

Most are relatively close -- not necessarily immediate neighborhood, but within maybe a mile. But that's not 100%.

### What are the afterschool options like?

Community School and [Dragonfly](http://dragonfly-asp.org/Dragonfly.asp). Community Schools is like the other schools -- you pick from a menu of courses and it's pretty structured. Dragonfly runs every single day, goes until 5:45 pm, and isn't overly scheduled, and provides more of an environment for play, relaxation. It's an independent not-for-profit with its own governing board. It's also a bit cheaper than Community Schools.

Graham and Parks starts at 8:25 am, and kids shouldn't be in classrooms before 8:15 am. That's a pretty narrow window. There are some before school options, but parent I spoke to wasn't familiar with what they were. 

### How is conflict resolved if there is bullying or harassment?

Parent I spoke to didn't know; had not heard of any incidents. School prides itself on being inclusive, and fostering a feeling of safety and respect for everyone, so there is a lot done proactively with making sure incidents don't get that far.

### How diverse is the school staff? 

Administrators are mostly white and more female than male. The teachers are almost all female. Of the JK teachers, two are white and one is of color, and flipped for assistant teachers, and all are women. 

### How happy are families about the school, generally speaking? Any reasons for leaving? What are the most common problems parents give about your school?

One family from Puerto Rico moved to Amigos for Spanish Immersion (got off of waitlist), others mostly due to moving out of Cambridge. Haven't really heard many complaints. In general, people love it.

### Tips for new families

* Be aware of afterschool signups
* Classrooms do family breakfasts; participate in those. Attend events and programs.

## Academics

### How do you differentiate instruction by student?  How are advanced learners handled (a few grade levels ahead)?  Help for kids that are struggling/need help? How about special needs students (e.g. autism, dyslexia, etc.)?  How common is it for students outside of the mainstream (in either direction) to transfer out of the school? How about different student interests? For example, if one student is very interested in biology, another in social justice, and a third in drawing…

Parent didn't know; child didn't need it. 

### Aside from the math, english, science, and social studies, what does the class day include? What are the music, arts, world language, etc. programs.

Specials once a day: gym twice a week, arts is once a week, library is once week, music is once a week.

In kindergarten there's a lot of choice time, which is basically freeplay between stations. 

Science and social studies are mixed, and social studies tends to have broader scope than science. Social studies tends to alternate year-by-year between focus on the self and focus on the community. Science talks about habitat, leaves changing color, etc.

### How is the day broken down on academic versus non-academic time? How much recess is there? How much do kids play otherwise? 

* Non-academic: Recess, lunch, and a special. Kindergarten also has choice time.
* Academic probably not more than 3-4 hours per day.

Note: Parent had mostly background for JK/K, didn't know older grades. Suspect maybe 4.5 hours academic time (lose choice time)

### How academically intense are the programs in grades 3-5?

(Parent didn't know; young child)

### Is there homework, and how much in each grade?

Starts in second grade, maybe?

### What role does MCAS play in the school and in curriculum design? What role does the Common Core play?

(Parent didn't know; young child)

### What modes of instruction are dominant (e.g. lecture, projects, groupwork, etc.)

(Parent didn't know; young child)

## Family Engagement

### Are parents welcome in classrooms? In the library?

Very much welcome. You have to register and check in (note: CPSD requirements). Very encouraging for parents to participate in different ways. Mystery readers. Parent volunteer for presentations to kids and other in-class projects. School is eager and happy to have parents participating like that. 

### Does the school act as a community center? For example, do parents tend to organize birthday parties and other events at the school or somewhere else?

The school community does a lot of events, but it's not really a community center in that way. Events tend to be pretty well attended. 

### What's communications with parents like (mailings, parent-teacher conferences, etc.)?

* Teachers send home a flyer every week -- "Here's what we've been working on: Kindergartners learned the letters 'K' and 'Z'," as well as information about school assemblies.
* Family liason sends out an email every two weeks with upcoming events and programs: School committee, food market, etc. 
* Monthly newsletter in backpacks: Letter from the principal. For example: How to approach parent-teacher conferences and how to maximize that time. Staff/faculty spotlight. Upcoming events (e.g. international night where people learn folk dances from different cultures). 

### What’s the role of the school council? How often does the school council vote? How many members of the community typically attend meetings? Teacher council? How involved is the community in decision-making?

It's called the steering committee. Parents are elected to be on it -- maybe four or five spots -- and they do vote. Parent I spoke to never attended a meeting, but it seems to play a visible role, be respected, and that it's a real body. There are ample reminders that everyone is welcome to attend.

### How transparent is the school?

It's pretty transparent. Never got partial answers or felt like information was withheld. 

## Community

### How friendly is the community? Do most parents know each other? How do the parents interact? What’s the best way to get to know other parents? Do families generally invite the whole class to birthday parties? How often do kids have playdates with classmates?

Parents get to know other parents via drop-off, pick-up and family breakfast, and playdates arise from that. It happens organically.

### How much time do parents spend in schools? How often do they come during pick-up/drop-off?

Most parents do come for pick-up/drop-off, since it's a community school. Some come by very quickly, some for longer. Many hang out for 5-15 minutes then. 

### What’s the main channel of communication among parents (mailing list, forum, face-to-face?)

Classroom parents set up mailing lists. They try to collect information in the fall. Parents use that fairly often for events, but not for discussion about what happens in the classroom.

### What’s the role of the PTO? What does it do? How many active parents in the PTO? 

Friends of Graham and Parks does fundraising: "This Friday is a movie night and there's a pizza." Those types of events. Steering committee does guidance/policy. 

### Do all the classes have room parents? Who is in charge of planning classroom events?

Probably all classes do. 

### How integrated is the school? 

Most of the students are from close by, but otherwise it feels pretty integrated.
