**If you're a parent at the school and would like to be interviewed about your experience, please [contact us](mailto:beccax@gmail.com) with general availability for a call (school hours, after kids go to bed, etc.).**

Cambridge has two related schools named after Dr. King which are sometimes confused by new parents. One is called King Open, and the other is called MLK (or MLK, Jr, or King). This article is about the King Open school. To add to the confusion, both schools have two tracks. MLK has a Chinese Immersion track, and a non-immersion track (with the **non-immersion** confused called nihao!), while King Open has a highly-regarded Portuguese immersion track, Ola. The Ola program is extremely strong, but due to the lower popularity of the language, remains probably the only magnet program in the district which parents can get into without sibling, language, or 3-year-old priority.

So on a school lottery sheet, you will see four different choices in schools named King. Make sure you pick the right one!

King Open is in a temporary location while the school is being rebuilt. It is currently in a run-down building at 359 Broadway, but will move to a brand-new state-of-the-art facility at 850 Cambridge St. as soon as the new building is finished, probably in a year. This building will probably be the nicest in the district, being both new and having large sports fields.

King Open is in the MIT-Central area, moving to MIT-Lechmere. The MIT area, which has *many* schools and not as many families, so like all other schools in this area, King Open tends to be pretty undersubscribed. If you list it first (either track), you'll probably get in.

## General

### What do most parents say they like the most about your school?

* **The community**. There are strong connections between the parents outside the school. In warm weather, parents get pizza every Wednesday.
* **Focus on social justice**. It's not just a shallow focus "Let's celebrate MLK," but it's deeply integrated into the curriculum
* **Ola classroom size**. In Ola, the student-teacher ratio is amazing. Since people move through Cambridge, and it's hard to transfer into an immersion program partway, by fifth grade, the Ola classroom has only eight kids. Parents are involved in classrooms too. The amount of 1:1 attention is tremendous; indeed, the problem is the opposite: Keeping classrooms full is a problem.

### Are most families from the neighborhood or spread throughout Cambridge?

King mainstream is more from the neighborhood, but not everyone. It doesn't feel like a neighborhood school. In Ola, it's very spread out. Probably less than half from the neighborhood

### What are the afterschool options like?

King Open has two afterschool programs: Extended Day and Community Schools. While some schools have stronger afterschool programs than either of these individually, what's unique is that they work together as a team making for a stronger combined program. A student can sign up for Extended Day, but take specific offering in Community Schools. Extended Day has play, homework help, and is relatively free-form. Community Schools has specific classes. Extended Day is also pretty unique in that the teachers are integrated into the normal classrooms -- in JK/K this means they usually spend time helping in the classroom during the school day, so they are acutely aware of anything going on, things the kids need to work on, etc. 

The program has a strong focus on socioemotional learning using the [Nurtured Heart Approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nurtured_Heart_Approach). It's focused on bringing out the best behavior of kids and refocuses classroom on the positive behavior of kids. The parent I spoke with was amazed at how well it worked (especially for managing difficult behavior). A second program also found the combination of that, with integration with normal classrooms, to be super-effective.

The school also has drop-in Portuguese homework help twice a week, once before school and once after, available even to kids not registered for afterschool.

### How is conflict resolved if there is bullying or harassment?

The parent I spoke to has never had any problems with either Principal Williams is very hands-on and tends towards early intervention before things become a problem. 

### How diverse is the school staff?

Most of the teachers tend to be women; there are a few male teachers (e.g. gym teacher). The principal is an African American male, and teacher diversity is an issue they're looking at and concerned about. 

### How happy are families about the school, generally speaking? Any reasons for leaving? What are the most common problems parents give about your school?

Families are generally very happy. Many families had not ranked KO due to proximity but have since declined waitlist spots since we all love KO so much and plan to stay forever. 

Getting priced out of the market is the major reason. Ola loses 1-2 families per year due to rising housing costs. The parent hadn't heard of people leaving because people were unhappy with the school; everyone loves the program. The biggest problem is the school facility; the school is in a temporary building which is not very good. The school addressed that pretty well in the interim -- taking kids to parks and otherwise -- but the lack of playground space is an issue. It will be resolved when the new building opens up.

There is a small group of families who feels strongly about testing and pull their kids out during tests. That leads to some friction and lower test scores. 

### Tips for new families

There are frequent appeals for:

* volunteering to help in library;
* becoming a room parent;
* principal chats;
* Friends of King Open meetings;
* School council meetings;
* attending events such as carnival and king open spring open;
* Parent-teacher night out; and
* weekend backpack program

Once you start attending events, you meet the other families that are active in the school community and get to know other parents. Parents who put their kids in the Extended Day program also have an advantage; a lot of the friendships develop there. And get to know Principal Williams. He's very welcoming and genuinely concerned about what parents have to say. He communicates well and is open to parent input. 

## Academics

### How do you differentiate instruction by student?  How are advanced learners handled (a few grade levels ahead)?  Help for kids that are struggling/need help? How about special needs students (e.g. autism, dyslexia, etc.)?  How common is it for students outside of the mainstream (in either direction) to transfer out of the school? How about different student interests? For example, if one student is very interested in biology, another in social justice, and a third in drawing…

The parent I spoke only had experience with Ola. Ola has an advantage in that it combines grades. JK/K are in one room. First and second grades collaborate, and third and fourth grades collaborate. The teachers are already teaching a wider range of abilities than most. The parent saw teachers effectively scale up to her child who is a year ahead in math. For kids with issues, the kids are pulled out. The school is sensitive to what time of day this happens. The parent I spoke to didn't know the exact strategy, but it wasn't same time each day (to distribute impact), and in contrast to some schools, it wasn't always during fun time.

For kids with particular interests, the parent gave an example of a child interested in money where the math curriculum was modified around that topic to give them a chance to become a sort of leader in the class.

### Aside from the math, English, science, and social studies, what does the class day include? What are the music, arts, world language, etc. programs.

Specials are the standard set of:

* Music;
* Art;
* Library; and
* Physical education twice a week

The major focus is social justice, which in some sense takes the place of possible other specials.

### How is the day broken down on academic versus non-academic time? How much recess is there? How much do kids play otherwise? 

The parent didn't know, but commented kids had an extra chance to play before school (drop off is at 8 while school starts at 8:40)

### How academically intense are the programs in grades 3-5?

The parent didn't now, but said that Ola tended to be a little more intense since while kids were, for example, learning science, they were also learning the associated Portuguese vocabulary for it as well

### Is there homework, and how much in each grade?

It's on a teacher-by-teacher basis. In Ola, in JK/K, it's optional, while all teachers 1st-5th give homework. In mainstream KO, one 3rd grade teacher had no homework. One 5th grader teacher had homework, but in a less structured form (responding to readings, etc.). Many kids finish all their homework during the Extended Day afterschool program.

### What role does MCAS play in the school and in curriculum design? What role does the Common Core play?

King Open's history places it at odds with MCAS. The school has been focused on project-based learning. That was watered down somewhat during the innovation agenda, but they've tried to keep that as much as possible. It's definitely not a school which is teaching to the test. Some parents are concerned about how kids are doing on the test, so it's definitely something they're paying attention to it, but it's less of a focus than many other schools. The project-based learning has a broader focus than the specifics of content. It still does to teach to the Common Core curriculum, but through the projects. 

### What modes of instruction are dominant (e.g. lecture, projects, group work, etc.)

Project-based learning, as much as possible

## Family Engagement

### Are parents welcome in classrooms? In the library?

King Open encourages parent involvement as much as possible. It's on a teacher-by-teacher basis, but the principal really encourages it and sets the tone. All the teachers the parent had interacted with really encouraged parents in classrooms. Parents can co-teach in classrooms, or come in for short visits to, for example, share about their cultures or their work. The librarian is fabulous and also very into engaging parents. 

### Does the school act as a community center? For example, do parents tend to organize birthday parties and other parent events at the school or somewhere else?

There are community events there, but organized by the school or Friends of King Open. Part of the problem is the temporary building....

### What's communications with parents like (mailings, parent-teacher conferences, etc.)?

Most of it comes home in a backpack on paper. Parent liaison sends emails 2-3 times per week about different events. 

### What’s the role of the school council? How often does the school council vote? How many members of the community typically attend meetings? Teacher council? How involved is the community in decision-making?

The parent I spoke to did not know. King Open has three major bodies and [a number of smaller ones](:

* [The Ola Committee](https://kingopen.cpsd.us/cms/One.aspx?portalId=3044251&pageId=3673393). which the parent was familiar with. This meets once every other month. It has 10-20 people at meetings. 1-2 teachers come too. Sometimes principal or an SC member will come as well. The primary goals are support current Ola families and communicating about Ola to new parents  (esp. to lower-income families who are often unfamiliar with it), but other initiatives include things such as organizing trips, and helping to organize the Carnival. The group has a Facebook page now as well. 
* [Friends of King Open](https://friendsofkingopen.com/) meets monthly.
* [School Council](https://kingopen.cpsd.us/cms/One.aspx?portalId=3044251&pageId=3673409) meets monthly

Parent was involved in Ola committee, so didn't know much about the other two.

The school has an open house in December. 

### How transparent is the school?

Principal Williams is very open and transparent and tries to communicate pro-actively about school issues, good or bad. He is very approachable. The parent did not believe that teacher free speech was an issue in King Open, as it is in some other schools. She couldn't think of a time teachers couldn't say what they wanted, and there is nothing from the principal about towing a party line. Some teachers are vocal about where they differ from the district. Teachers are aware they are school employee and that does place some limits. And while the Principal is open to input and transparent, he is not easily pushed around by more vocal parents.

## Community

### How friendly is the community? Do most parents know each other? How do the parents interact? What’s the best way to get to know other parents? Do families generally invite the whole class to birthday parties? How often do kids have playdates with classmates?

Ola is different from King Open. 

* King Open: My son is in K (non-Ola) and one of our favorite things about KO is the community. We have made wonderful friends, have attended and hosted entire-class parties. Weekend is now full of school friend playdates and get together -- several families coordinated to send their kids to the same camp together last year, etc. 
* Ola: The parent I spoke to from Ola described it as really tight nit, especially because the classrooms are really small. It's also the same kids together from kindergarten to fifth grade, so it's really close group like a family. It's like brothers and sisters. Some make jokes about it having the feel of a dysfunction family. All the birthday parties in Ola are entire class.

King Open Extended Day has a lot of their own social activities as well. Meal of Thanks around Thanksgiving. KOED events are a nice way to meet parents too. 

### How much time do parents spend in schools? How often do they come during pick up/drop-off?

The parent I spoke with didn't know; they worked long hours.

*The Editor spent a day in Ola. The classroom had parents visit to present about their culture for about a half-hour in the morning. Each family was invited to make one such visit during the year about their own cultural background. For the rest of the day, aside from the Editor, the classroom had four adults in the classroom the whole time: the teacher, the co-teacher, a relative of a student, and an ed school student who wanted to learn about immersion programs. The level of both community engagement and student-to-adult ratio was very high.*

### What’s the main channel of communication among parents (mailing list, forum, face-to-face?)

* Yahoo LISTSERV for parents. It's a good way to find out parent perspective rather than just school's position. Parents discuss e.g. if there are ways to address limited recess, issues around the temporary building, etc.
* There is now a little on Friends of King Open Facebook site, but most things happen on the LISTSERV still.

### What’s the role of the PTO? What does it do? How many active parents in the PTO? 

* Buy supplies for teachers
* Babysitting for meetings (Friends of King Open, School Council, and Ola Committee)
* Events: Spring Fling, Carnival, etc. 

### Do all the classes have room parents? Who is in charge of planning classroom events?

* Usually 1-3 room parents per classroom
* Teachers organize breakfasts throughout the year (e.g. for parents to have a chance to see student projects)
* Room parents organize supplies for classrooms (e.g. hand sanitizer)
* Room parents send out reminders (e.g. permission slips)
* Room parents usually don't organize events

### How integrated is the school? 

The parent's impression was that King Open is pretty well integrated, and Ola definitely is. She hadn't seen any self-segregation in Ola, in the cafeteria, or in King Open Extended Day. Part of that she attributed to th closeness of the students and the small groups.

### What about all the Kings?

To clear up some confusion, and add a bit of history, the Cambridge School District originally had just one school named after Martin Luther King. At the time, Graham and Parks was an extremely progressive, open, and oversubscribed school (you can read [its story](http://www.nonpartisaneducation.org/Review/Testimonials/v10n2.htm)). Parents looking for a similar model opened up an open classroom pilot at the MLK school. For many years, the school had two programs: mainstream and King Open. Eventually, with frictions between the two tracks, King Open split off into its own school, while MLK kept a more traditional education model (which it still follows today). Both schools later created immersion language tracks: Ola Portuguese Immersion at King Open and many years later, Chinese Immersion at MLK. So now we have two schools and four lottery choices named after Dr. King.
