With the success of Graham and Parks in the seventies, more parents wishing an open classroom than G+P could support. A group of parents in the MLK school created their own open classroom, where parents and community members were welcome to actively participate in classrooms. Eventually, this school split off into King Open. King Open is in a temporary location while the school is being rebuilt. It is currently in a run-down building at 359 Broadway, but will move to a brand-new state-of-the-art facility at 850 Cambridge St. as soon as the new building is finished, probably in a year.
