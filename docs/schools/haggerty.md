Haggerty is located in north-west Cambridge, in the Fresh Pond area. It's moderately subscribed; if you list it first, you have a good shot of making it in. The statistics on it don't quite line up with how the district describes the lottery; in 2016-2017, not all students who listed Haggerty first were assigned (70-90% made it in), but several students who listed it second or third made it in. We're not quite sure what happened.
