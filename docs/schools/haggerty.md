Haggerty is located in north-west Cambridge, in the Fresh Pond area. It's moderately subscribed; if you list it first, you have a good shot of making it in. The statistics on it don't quite line up with how the district describes the lottery; in 2016-2017, not all students who listed Haggerty first were assigned (70-90% made it in), but several students who listed it second or third made it in. We're not quite sure what happened. 

## General

### What do most parents say they like the most about your school?

It's one of the smallest in schools (about 200 students JK-5th). It's very intimate. The principal knows every student very well, and teachers usually knows everyone's name too. In some ways, it feels more like a daycare than a school.

### Are most families from the neighborhood or spread throughout Cambridge?

Kids come from all over. The parent I interviewed lived on opposite side of town, and picked the option for the warm, intimate feeling.

### What are the afterschool options like?

Like most schools, Haggerty has a [Community School](https://www.cambridgema.gov/DHSP/programsforkidsandyouth/communityschools/haggertycommunityschool). It doesn't have a DHSP option. The program was described as very warm, loving, and flexible. The parent I spoke with had two kids. The older was in structured classes: chess, Spanish, tennis and soccer. The younger didn't do well with structure, and was allowed to just play Lego.

There's a good selection of classes, although it's more limited in younger grades.

*Editor's note: We recommend looking at brochures from the city to get a feel for specific options.*

### How is conflict resolved if there is bullying or harassment?

Principal and teachers are very quick; they respond immediately. They bring everyone into room, develop an action plan, and then do followup to make sure that plan is followed.

There are posters against bullying all over school. 

### How diverse is the school staff? 

Teachers are primarily white, some Asian. The parent I spoke with only knew of one male teacher. There were African American teachers in the afterschool program, but she wasn't aware of ones in normal program. Teachers did have different sexual orientations which brought in a different type of diversity.

### How happy are families about the school, generally speaking? Any reasons for leaving? What are the most common problems parents give about your school?

Families are very happy. Not many students leave for reasons other than moving. The school does have the usual public school problem of challenging students who are significantly advanced students with materials that are sufficiently high-level to be interesting.

*Editor's note: From conversations with parents with advanced learners, most schools have this problem; it didn't come up in some of the other interviews more due to lack of familiarity with how such students are handled than from having better programs n place for advanced learners.*

### Tips for new families

## Academics

### How do you differentiate instruction by student?  How are advanced learners handled (a few grade levels ahead)?  Help for kids that are struggling/need help? How about special needs students (e.g. autism, dyslexia, etc.)?  How common is it for students outside of the mainstream (in either direction) to transfer out of the school? How about different student interests? For example, if one student is very interested in biology, another in social justice, and a third in drawing…

The parent I spoke to had a special-needs child. She was blown away with how responsive the school was to the child's needs. Many people in the school check in regularly with her and talk about progress and challenges, and she has a lot of interactions with people in IEP response. It's really managed well.

The school works very hard to keep special-needs students in the school and not do out-of-school placement.

*Editor's note: Many schools in the district place students with more difficult needs in special schools out-of-district. There is strong pressure to do so, both from test scores and sometimes from other parents. Special needs parents I spoke with prefer in-school management. It's also a lot less expensive to manage in-school for the district as a whole (although since only one comes from school budget, the incentives are sometimes more aligned to do out-of-school placement).*

Parent I spoke with didn't know exactly how advanced learners are handled.

### Aside from the math, english, science, and social studies, what does the class day include? What are the music, arts, world language, etc. programs.

* 4x week [Kodaly music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kod%C3%A1ly_method)
* 1x computer class
* Growth mindset intervention
* Meditation/yoga
* Art. The art teacher is a reasonably well-known in Cambridge and does a lot of local exhibitions. Art is maybe 2x a week (parent wasn't sure)
* PE

No foreign languages are taught in the school.

### How is the day broken down on academic versus non-academic time? How much recess is there? How much do kids play otherwise? 

Recess is once per day, and there is not much play from 2nd grade on. Kids do have a toy area in the classroom for choice time with things like train sets. 

Kindergarten looks more like a preschool with lots of Legos, imaginary play, dress-up, block area, craft area, etc. 

*Editor's note: Limited recesses are common in most schools without extended days. It's due to state requirements around number of hours of [structured learning time](http://www.doe.mass.edu/lawsregs/603cmr27_guide.html).*

### How academically intense are the programs in grades 3-5?

The parent I spoke with didn't know. 

### Is there homework, and how much in each grade?

The parent I spoke with reported that her kids had no required homework from kindergarten though second grade, but didn't know about higher grades. As with all schools, parents were asked to read with kids for 20 minutes per day.

The teachers did send a lot of optional enrichment activities parents could do with kids. She occasionally received envelopes with little cards of addition and subtraction problems on Fridays, or classroom newsletters with suggestions on what one can do at home.

But this does depend on the teacher; she mentioned one of the other 1st grade teachers did give some homework. 

### What role does MCAS play in the school and in curriculum design? What role does the Common Core play?

The school is absolutely not teaching to the test and MCAS plays an absolutely minor role. While it has a very good academic program, it has one of the weaker MCAS results because they don't teach to the test or focus on the test. Instead, teachers can be very creative with lots of interesting projects and similar work.

The parent I spoke with felt teachers were given a fair amount of leeway around curriculum relative to Common Core and Mass Curriculum standards (but I wasn't sure if she understood how those differed from MCAS).

### What modes of instruction are dominant (e.g. lecture, projects, groupwork, etc.)

* In kindergarten, learning is all project-based. One year the class centered on the rainforest, and the other year, around dinosaurs. Most of what kids did centered on those themes. Kids stayed in same classroom for JK and K, and the flip gave kids who did both grades different themes each year. At the end of the dinosaur/rainforest unit to, kids showcase what they learned (e.g. conservation efforts in rainforests, the different types of wood etc.) to their families.
* In first and second grade, there are little units of project-based learning, but other types become more important as well: lecture-based and group-based.
* My impression from the description of the classroom was a fair amount of group-based. For example, the kids sit in assigned groups/tables, but no assigned seats. 

The school experiments with curriculum and modes of instruction. The parent walked me through a second grade project centered on geology. Kids were put into a small groups, each which looked at a different area:

* One group worked on how wind and water shapes mountains. They made a hands-on project which demonstrated erosion.
* Another learned how maps are created. They learned to read legends, what colors on maps meant, and how marks represented different geological features.
* One group built a mountain of sand and rocks and put water to see how one can avoid sand and gravel coming onto the street.

The kids learned about engineers versus geologists versus cartographers. In their music class, they wrote a song which they then performed. There was a science fair for parents, where parents came in at 8 am. When the project was finished, they asked parents for lots of feedback about how it went, how engaged students were, what worked, what didn't, etc. to improve for following years. They also asked parents to email the class about what they learned from the fair, and teachers read the emails to the children. This was done across both 2nd grade classrooms, with the teachers working together closely, and parents visiting both classrooms.

This sort of experimentation, feedback, community involvement, and continuous improvement is common to how the school operates. 

*In talking to parents, it's nice to see this sort of cross-grade community develop. Kids are usually reshuffled year-to-year and it is nice if there are venues for long-term friendships to continue to build in school.*

## Family Engagement

### Are parents welcome in classrooms? In the library?

Parents are very welcome. One parent -- a neuroscientist -- had just done a series of seminars in both classrooms for her child's grades two weeks in a row on the brain, and other parents were encouraged to do likewise in their fields of expertise. Teachers also often ask for help or volunteers when relevant.

In kindergarten, every family comes to the classroom once for 1 hour in the morning to showcase something about their family. Samilies talk about things like:
* Their culture and language (one brought food from their country).
* Things they like to do (one family liked hiking and brought a tent that they set up with the kids)
* Etc.

### Does the school act as a community center? For example, do parents tend to organize birthday parties and other parent events at the school or somewhere else?

There are lots of events at the school, including: 

* A folk dance event a few weeks ago. The 2nd graders presented dances from different cultures and everyone joined in; about a hundred people danced folk dances from African, European, Asian, etc. cultures;
* Regular lectures where they invite authors;
* Informal playtime afterschool on the playground for kids not in afterschool;
* Get-to-know parents international potluck dinner;
* A lot of venues where student work is showcased (afterschool recitals, the above science fair, etc.) and student can demonstrated what they did to a community; and
* Lots of movie nights, spaghetti dinner, etc. 

Parents will occasionally book the gym for birthdays

### What's communications with parents like (mailings, parent-teacher conferences, etc.)?

* Primary mode of communication is through email (esp. from family liaison) and backpack express
* There are automated phone call reminders about specific events from the family liaison as well (e.g. "We have a waffle dinner tonight")

### What’s the role of the school council? How often does the school council vote? How many members of the community typically attend meetings?  How involved is the community in decision-making?

Didn't know, but meetings are very widely announced.

### How transparent is the school?

It's generally fairly transparent. The parents are pretty involved and get engaged if something is not as transparent as it ought to be. 

## Community

### How friendly is the community? Do most parents know each other? How do the parents interact? What’s the best way to get to know other parents? Do families generally invite the whole class to birthday parties? How often do kids have playdates with classmates?

The school is very small -- by fifth grade, there are perhaps around 14 students. Because it's so small, everyone knows everyone and there is a lot of parent communications.

There are both types of birthday parties. Kindergartners tend to invite the whole class (and this mode is encouraged by the teachers). In older grades, often just 3-4 kids go to movies or something. Families who don't invite everyone are asked to do it by private email (not to leave invitations in student cubbies). 

### How much time do parents spend in schools? How often do they come during pick up/drop-off?

People chat after drop-off, and there are parent coffees after drop-off a few times a year. There is a beautiful playground which was redone recently, so lots of families whose kids don't go to afterschool hang out in the playground after school dismissal. 

### What’s the main channel of communication among parents (mailing list, forum, face-to-face?)

Mostly face-to-face, and some SMS. There are class mailing lists but these are rarely used except by room parents as an official communications channel. 

### What’s the role of the PTO? What does it do? How many active parents in the PTO? 

It's very active and its primary role is to raise funds for field trips. All 5th graders go on an overnight field-trip, typically to a location like a farm in Vermont. It also raises money for authors to visit the school. The organization tries to have a different author come in each month, and it pays for travel/logistics when authors are coming in from further out.

### Do all the classes have room parents? Who is in charge of planning classroom events?

* All classes have two room parents
* Teachers often ask for donations: tissues, pencils, etc. People sign up on Google Sheet as to what they will contribute
* Events or organized by room parents, but in close collaboration with the teachers

To give a few examples of events, in the first grade, there was an authors' morning. Each child wrote a story. Parents came into the school in the morning (with breakfast in the classroom) and would walk station to station where kids read their stories.

*Editor's note: This sort of showcasing of student work is almost unique to Haggerty; a few schools do this a little bit, but in our conversation, it came up over and over in examples. That's a good way to both keep students motivated (there's a real audience for their work!) and to keep parents engaged in the schools.*

### How integrated is the school? 

The school is very integrated. Playdates happen across all boundaries -- racial, socioeconomic, gender, etc. The parent I spoke to had a child whose friends were mostly of the opposite gender, for example. The school has a motto: "Everyone is different. Everyone belongs." This motto is postered all over the school. The kids have totally internalized this attitude. For special needs students, there is extra communications to other kids about keeping them integrated and included. 

### Haggerty came up a few times in school committee meetings recently. What's that about?

In the fall, the school committee was asked to provide additional funding to two school to deal with specific issues: Putnam Ave Upper School and Haggerty. PAUS has abysmal pass rates on a state algebra exam. The reporting on the issues at Haggerty [in the press](http://www.cambridgeday.com/2017/06/10/affirmation-of-protection-for-immigrants-among-flurry-of-actions-by-school-officials/) was spotty, and so we spoke a bit about this issue. The former 2nd/new 3rd grade has a few behaviorally-challenged kids who were disrupting classes. The school wanted to keep them in the same classes (which is considered the right thing for special-needs students; out-of-school placement is expensive and takes them out of a healthy community they are familiar with). To manage the issue, the school split two classrooms into three classrooms with an extra teacher. They wanted to maintain this format going forward.
