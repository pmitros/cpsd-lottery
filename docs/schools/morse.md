Morse is a school in the MIT area, to the west of MIT, close to the river, Trader Joes, and Microcenter. The MIT area, which has *many* schools and fewer families, where tend to be pretty undersubscribed. If you list it first, you'll probably get in.

## General

This interview was a little bit short and we had a poor phone connection; pardon the gaps.

### What do most parents say they like the most about your school?

**Love the community**. Well-educated, diverse, lots of love and social opportunities. Parents are amazing, kids are amazing

### Are most families from the neighborhood or spread throughout Cambridge?

Ton of kids from the neighborhood, and a sprinkling from elsewhere.

### What are the afterschool options like?

There is the Morse Afterschool and the Community Schools. Both are highly regarded -- good options: homework help, wrapup time, playing games, things like chess, architecture, tc.

### How is conflict resolved if there is bullying or harassment?

Parent wasn't sure; impression was that it was handled well.

### How diverse is the school staff? 

We ran out of time before I got to this one.

### How happy are families about the school, generally speaking? Any reasons for leaving? What are the most common problems parents give about your school?

Very happy. Most frequent is moving. Parent I spoke to couldn't think of complaints. 

### Tips for new families

* Get involved! Find something that you really like to do (maybe the workshops or the events or social events). You will make good friends and connections if you do those things. Go to the events that interest you!
* Have good communications with teachers; it's easy to do that. The teachers are very respected and proactive and on top of academics.
* If something needs to shift, make sure everyone agrees, and set up a system of accountability. Define goals, points to check in, ownership, etc.

## Academics

### How do you differentiate instruction by student?  How are advanced learners handled (a few grade levels ahead)?  Help for kids that are struggling/need help? How about special needs students (e.g. autism, dyslexia, etc.)?  How common is it for students outside of the mainstream (in either direction) to transfer out of the school? How about different student interests? For example, if one student is very interested in biology, another in social justice, and a third in drawing…

Special needs kids are pretty well incorporated. One child had a significant mental disability; still had lots of friends, seemed happy, well-adjusted, and kids related well. The plans 

Advanced kids, the parent wasn't sure about, but I picked up a mixed impression

### Aside from the math, english, science, and social studies, what does the class day include? What are the music, arts, world language, etc. programs.

A ton of music. Visual arts. PE. Special reading/library teacher. Technology component. 

### How is the day broken down on academic versus non-academic time? How much recess is there? How much do kids play otherwise? 

Impression was that younger kids probably have two recesses and older kids one. It's weather-dependent for whether kids go outdoors.

### How academically intense are the programs in grades 3-5?

Parent wasn't sure.

### Is there homework, and how much in each grade?

Up to the teacher, but there was homework in 1st and 2nd grade. It was about 15 minutes of math and 20 minutes of reading. The format varies.

### What role does MCAS play in the school and in curriculum design? What role does the Common Core play?

[Parent wasn't sure]

### What modes of instruction are dominant (e.g. lecture, projects, groupwork, etc.)

Students usually sit with 3-4 desks together. Mixed modes of instruction based on kids' cycles of energy: Project work. Individual work. Etc.

## Family Engagement

### Are parents welcome in classrooms? In the library?

The parent I spoke to had the impression that parents every teacher is a little different in terms of how much classroom presence parents can have, but generally, that they were very welcome. Wasn't completely sure, though (had never volunteered in a classroom). 

### Does the school act as a community center? For example, do parents tend to organize birthday parties and other parent events at the school or somewhere else?

It does, but somewhat differently than most schools I spoke with. There was a serious number of things like workshops -- sometimes several in one week: learn math how kids do math, literacy issues. Fair number of other events, volunteering, etc. Parent said "Very vibrant community. Amazing community. Very happy."

### What's communications with parents like (mailings, parent-teacher conferences, etc.)?

Teachers send literature/pamphlets about what kids are learning each month. Her teacher also has an app which she sends messages on. Overall, it works very well.

There is also an email list from school to parents, as well as from the PTO to the parents (I think all schools have this).

### What’s the role of the school council? How often does the school council vote? How many members of the community typically attend meetings? Teacher council? How involved is the community in decision-making?

Parent I spoke to wasn't sure. Generally, the administration seemed pretty responsive, though.

### How transparent is the school?

Impression was very transparent.

## Community

### How friendly is the community? Do most parents know each other? How do the parents interact? What’s the best way to get to know other parents? Do families generally invite the whole class to birthday parties? How often do kids have playdates with classmates?

See below about communications. There's a strong community mostly organizing over email and SMS.

### How much time do parents spend in schools? How often do they come during pick up/drop-off?

I didn't get a very clear answer, but see above about workshops.

### What’s the main channel of communication among parents (mailing list, forum, face-to-face?)

Mailing lists and texting groups are common. Most classes have class-wide mailing lists. In addition, parents sometimes set up texting groups and email lists too. Overall, it's easy to be in touch with other parents.

### What’s the role of the PTO? What does it do? How many active parents in the PTO? 

[We didn't discuss this]

### Do all the classes have room parents? Who is in charge of planning classroom events?

Some rooms have classroom parents and some don't.

### How integrated is the school? 

The school is very diverse (and the statistics show that) -- kids of all races, multiracial, bilingual, etc. Inside the school, it's very integrated. Outside of school, it's integrated on race, but less so on socioeconomic status. Kids have playdates mostly of same gender, but have friends across gender.
