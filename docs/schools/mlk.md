####Q. Are most families from the neighborhood or spread throughout Cambridge?
I would estimate about half around the school, the other half spread out. 

####Q. What are the afterschool options like?  What do most people do for afterschool?  How do they like it?
Most people do the community school, they love the variety and Martha runs a great program.  There’s also MLK Afterschool from the DHSP, but that has a long waitlist as it’s for only about 40 kids.

####Q. How is conflict resolved if there is bullying or harassment?
I have personal experience with this: first I tell the teacher, who often takes care of it.  Then there’s also the assistant principal, who’d bring the two families together to talk about things. She’s really good at conflict resolution.   I have known kids who transferred out of a class because they can’t get along with another kid.

####Q. How diverse is the school staff? 
At the kindergarten level, two of the five english teachers are African American.  And of course we have Chinese-speaking teachers to teach Chinese.  The principal is Asian, and many support staff are African American.

####Q. How happy are families about the school, generally speaking? Any tension or reason for leaving?
Most people I talk to seem very happy with the school.  The kids generally like their teachers a lot. The Music teacher Mr. Piper everyone raves about.  A few kids in the upper grades complain about stricter teachers, which is generally not a big concern for parents.  The immersion program is hard to get into so there’s some complaints about getting in.  MLK has a history, used to be more of a community school for surrounding families, vs. now there’s more demographic changes and Chinese immersion draws kids from all over the city. The school tries to address the multi-cultural heritage with both Chinese New Year and MLK African American history month, still there’s more we could probably do. 

The main reason for leaving is due to families moving away, though I have seen a few cases of people transferring to private school in either K or 3rd grade for more academic rigor, or because their kids need a bit more nurturing than what public schools tend to provide.

####Q. Any tips for new families to make the most of it?
The families that get involved tend to really like the school.  There’s a very friendly group of volunteers for the MLK Friends, our PTO.  They are always looking for volunteers and there’s plenty to do.  It’s got reasonable diversity too including dads, new immigrant families, and native Cambridge folks.  Getting to know them is like getting to know a whole new set of friends. :)   Also each class has room parents and they tend to do a good job connecting people.
