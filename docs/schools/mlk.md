The Cambridge School District has long had a school named after Martin Luther King. In 1975, an open classroom pilot was started at MLK (based on Graham and Parks) which eventually split off into the King Open school, while MLK kept a more traditional education model. In 2011, an innovative Chinese Immersion program was created within the MLK school, and now the school is split, with about 40% of students in the immersion track, and about 60% in the non-immersion track. Students from both tracks mix (and increasingly in higher grades, where the English half of the day becomes fully integrated).

The immersion track tends to be **extremely** oversubscribed.

###Q. Are most families from the neighborhood or spread throughout Cambridge?
I would estimate about half around the school, the other half spread out. 

###Q. What are the afterschool options like?  What do most people do for afterschool?  How do they like it?
Most people do the community school, they love the variety and Martha runs a great program.  There’s also MLK Afterschool from the DHSP, but that has a long waitlist as it’s for only about 40 kids.

###Q. How is conflict resolved if there is bullying or harassment?
I have personal experience with this: first I tell the teacher, who often takes care of it.  Then there’s also the assistant principal, who’d bring the two families together to talk about things. She’s really good at conflict resolution. I have known kids who transferred out of a class because they can’t get along with another kid.

###Q. How diverse is the school staff? 
At the kindergarten level, two of the five english teachers are African American.  And of course we have Chinese-speaking teachers to teach Chinese.  The principal is Asian, and many support staff are African American.

###Q. How happy are families about the school, generally speaking? Any tension or reason for leaving?
Most people I talk to seem very happy with the school.  The kids generally like their teachers a lot. The Music teacher Mr. Piper everyone raves about.  A few kids in the upper grades complain about stricter teachers, which is generally not a big concern for parents.  The immersion program is hard to get into so there’s some complaints about getting in.  MLK has a history, used to be more of a community school for surrounding families, vs. now there’s more demographic changes and Chinese immersion draws kids from all over the city. The school tries to address the multi-cultural heritage with both Chinese New Year and MLK African American history month, still there’s more we could probably do. 

The main reason for leaving is due to families moving away, though I have seen a few cases of people transferring to private school in either K or 3rd grade for more academic rigor, or because their kids need a bit more nurturing than what public schools tend to provide.

###Q. Any tips for new families to make the most of it?
The families that get involved tend to really like the school.  There’s a very friendly group of volunteers for the MLK Friends, our PTO.  They are always looking for volunteers and there’s plenty to do.  It’s got reasonable diversity too including dads, new immigrant families, and native Cambridge folks.  Getting to know them is like getting to know a whole new set of friends. :)   Also each class has room parents and they tend to do a good job connecting people. 

## Academics
### How do you differentiate instruction by student?  How are advanced learners handled (a few grade levels ahead)?  Help for kids that are struggling/need help? How about special needs students (e.g. autism, dyslexia, etc.)?  How common is it for students outside of the mainstream (in either direction) to transfer out of the school?  How about different student interests? For example, if one student is very interested in biology, another in social justice, and a third in drawing…

As a parent, I'm less familiar on those.  I do know that a number of teachers have experience with differentiation.  One of the kindergarten teacher mentioned when the district did a book on differentiation, they talked to her.  My son sits in a group with a couple of other kids for more advanced math problems. And while he was ahead on reading he was at grade-level on writing so they helped him with that. Some parents have complained about advanced students not receiving adequately challenging support. 

### Aside from the math, English, science, and social studies, what does the class day include? What are the music, arts, world language, etc. programs.

Everyday my kids get a special class, either music, art, gym, or library.  

### How is the day broken down on academic versus non-academic time? How much recess is there? How much do kids play otherwise? 

Not sure. 

### How academically intense are the programs in grades 3-5?

Hard for me to compare but I've bought grade-level activity books for my kids and they are able to do those in their grade fine or even a grade beyond. 

### Is there homework, and how much in each grade?

Not in grades JK-2, and that's a change since 2016 or so.  And in 3rd grade there's optional homework.  Gotta be honest I don't think my son did them the first couple of months in the term and the teacher didn't think it a problem.  I am asking my son to start owning his homework more.  It's not a lot. Usually my son can finish the week's homework in a day or 2.  The kids are asked to read everyday which they generally do anyway.  

### What role does MCAS play in the school and in curriculum design? What role does the Common Core play?

The curriculum is tied to Common Core.  The school pays close attention to MCAS results, on a question-by-question basis, and adjusts curriculum to where students are underperforming on the MCAS. 

### What modes of instruction are dominant (e.g. lecture, projects, groupwork, etc.)

Not sure

## Family Engagement 
### What's communications with parents like (mailings, parent-teacher conferences, etc.)?
We have parent-teacher conferences twice a year.  Teachers typically send a weekly or monthly summary about learning home via flyers, unfortunately my kids are not reliable with backpacks.   One of our kids' teachers started sending emails about what kids learned on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, and that's been great!

Whenever I've brought up concerns about my kids with the teachers, whether academic or social issues, we've been very happy with the response from the teachers.  They clearly want to work with families to get issues resolved.  And multiple teachers have gone the extra mile, we we really appreciate. 

The principal and our family liaison Marguerite sends regular newsletters out to keep us informed.  Marguerite also emails us about events going on.  As part of my work with the PTO and parent advocacy, I've interacted with Mrguerite and she's been very responsive and helpful.

### Are parents welcome in classrooms? In the library?
I visited the classrooom back in JK and since then I've gone back a couple of times to read books or for science day.  I do notice we're asked less and less to go into classrooms.  (Not just upper-grade issue, as my daughter is in K now.)  I'm not sure why that is, as many parents have expressed to me they don't know what's going on at school and would like to visit the class (and in some cases, have not been permitted to do so for more than very short visits).  You know what, I'm gonna ask about this.

I've only been in the library for book fair a couple years back, and more recently not.

### Does the school act as a community center? For example, do parents tend to organize birthday parties and other parent events at the school or somewhere else?

All the PTO-held events targeting parens are held at the school.

Recently the word got out that you could book the gym for birthday parties thru a city form.  So I noticed both more parties at school and talk of booking the gym. :)  

### What’s the role of the school council? How often does the school council vote? How many members of the community typically attend meetings?  How involved is the community in decision-making?

The school council is run by the school and parent rep.  Mostly the school informs parents of what's going on, and depends on the topic, you'll get different number of parents showing up.  I haven't been to one in a couple of years, maybe 10-12 parents at the last one I ttended?  There's not much decision making going on.  We've had only one or two vote in maybe last 5 years, I've heard. 

### How transparent is the school?

The principal Gerald is generally available to meet up with parents to discuss issues on their mind.  He's good at hearing you out.  The teachers are very responsive on discussing individual student needs but more reluctant to talk about general issues at the schools.  They typically refers you to talk to the principal.

## Community
### How friendly is the community? Do most parents know each other? How do the parents interact? What’s the best way to get to know other parents? Do families generally invite the whole class to birthday parties? How often do kids have playdates with classmates?
### How much time do parents spend in schools? How often do they come during pick up/drop-off?
### What’s the main channel of communication among parents (mailing list, forum, face-to-face?)
### What’s the role of the PTO? What does it do? How many active parents in the PTO? 
### Do all the classes have room parents? Who is in charge of planning classroom events?
### How integrated is the school?
