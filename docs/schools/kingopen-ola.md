King Open Ola! is a Portugese immersion program. Most parents pick Spanish or Chinese, simply due to the relative numbers of speakers, and the Portugese community in Cambridge has declined in numbers over the years, so Ola! is the only immersion program in the district where kids can get in without priority points. 

And what a program it is! The JK/K classroom is run by one of the best teachers in the district. As the name implies, it is an open classroom, with strong community involvement. On a typical day, there might be four adults working with kids. From there, classes get smaller and smaller with each year: Ola has a combined JK/K classroom, and only the K class moves into first grade. In addition, Cambridge has large turnover of students, and it's hard to come into immersion programs in higher grades, so the outflex isn't offset by influx. The result is an incredibly effective program, even independent of learning the Portugese language. There's a strong parent community.
