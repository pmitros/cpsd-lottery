King Open Ola! is a Portuguese immersion program. Most parents pick Spanish or Chinese, simply due to the relative numbers of speakers, and the Portuguese community in Cambridge has declined in numbers over the years, so Ola! is the only immersion program in the district where kids can get in without priority points or being in lower socioeconomic brackets. 

And what a program it is! The JK/K classroom is run by one of the best teachers in the district (a high bar). As the name implies, it is an open classroom, with strong community involvement. There might be several volunteers working with the kids alongside the teachers (which works really well). From there, classes get smaller and smaller with each year: Ola has a combined JK/K classroom, and only the K class moves onto first grade. Cambridge, having many postdoc/grad student/tech families, also has large turnover of students. Since it's hard to come into immersion programs in higher grades, out-flex of students isn't offset by an equal influx in immersion programs. The result are small classrooms and is an incredibly effective program, even independent of learning the Portuguese language.

Oh, and there's also a strong parent community.

More information is on the main King Open page. We interviewed one parent for both programs since many parts are common to both.
