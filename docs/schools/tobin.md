Tobin is a Montessori program. The Montessori Method of education is a child-centered educational approach which views the child as one who is naturally eager for knowledge and capable of initiating learning in a supportive, thoughtfully prepared learning environment. Children have a choice of activity from within a prescribed range of options and a fair degree of freedom.

Tobin tends to be highly oversubscribed, with priority to kids who were admitted through the 3-year-old lottery. Many years, there are few or no slots for children who were neither in this program nor have a sibling in the school. Unless you go through the 3-year-old lottery, you probably won't make it into Tobin.
