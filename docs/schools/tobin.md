If you plan to go to Tobin, please be aware of the different deadlines for [the 3-year-old lottery](http://www.cpsd.us/departments/frc/registering_for/new_3_year_old_lottery) which is the primary path into the school. 

## Disclaimer

**This interview happened in late January. The parents we made a very heavy editorial pass over the interview writeup which removed most or all of the negative or controversial comments and repositioned others. We generally aim to keep both upsides and downsides of schools and to maintain a more neutral tone, since the question is generally one of school fit rather than of school quality, and parents ought to know upsides and shortcoming of each model.**

**Since the interview was so late in the cycle, we have not had time for back-and-forth to figure out how to best integrate those portions back or bring this into a more neutral tone. We always recommend against relying on this site as an exclusive source of information, but we especially recommend doing some level of independent research about Tobin until we've either followed up with the parents (which we simply haven't had time for) or are able to interview someone else to fill the gaps (the parents were already super-generous with their time).**

**If you'd be willing to fill some of the gaps in time for the 2019 lottery, please [contact us](mailto:beccax@gmail.com) with general availability for a call). We're big fans of Tobin and the Montessori method, but it is quite different from traditional schools. It's important for parents to know for which families it is a fit and for which ones it is not.**

**This statement should not reflect poorly on the school or anyone else involved; every school has upsides and downsides, and the issues at Tobin didn't sound worse than anywhere else (indeed, I was quite impressed with the school and the issues were, in my mind, relatively minor for most families); it's just that this interview was done under extreme time pressure, which placed some strain on the process, the result of which is that the published version of this interview almost entirely omits anything negative or controversial about the school.**

## General Background

The [Tobin Montessori School’s](https://tobin.cpsd.us/) mission is to combine the best practices of [Montessori philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education) and public education to develop children who are resilient learners and who construct cooperative, caring communities. Tobin Montessori is one of just a handful of public Montessori schools in Massachusetts and has received the American Montessori Society (AMS) Initial Accreditation—AMS Accreditation positions Tobin within the best Montessori programs nationwide. Interested parents should look to the Tobin website and do some homework on the Montessori Method. The Montessori philosophy views the child as one who is naturally eager for knowledge and capable of initiating learning in a supportive, thoughtfully prepared learning environment. Children have a choice of activities from within a prescribed range of options and a fair degree of freedom and independence with teachers acting as guides.

The Tobin program places kids in mixed grade classrooms at three levels:

* Children's House: 3-year olds, junior kindergarten, and kindergarten
* Lower Elementary (or, Lower El) 1st through 3rd grades
* Upper Elementary (Upper El) 4th and 5th grades

Per the Montessori methodology, students spend three years in the same classroom, with the exception of Upper El at Tobin, which combines 4th and 5th grades (typically, the Upper El in Montessori schools would include 4th, 5th, and 6th grades but this was changed when Cambridge changed to a preK-5th grade elementary school model). These multi-age classrooms focus on developmental needs of the child. Parents spoke about the close community that can form around each classroom due to the fewer transitions, for child, teachers, class cohort, and families/caregivers in those classrooms. Classes are balanced by age as well (so a classroom will have approximately the same number of 1st graders, 2nd graders, and 3rd graders). The admissions model is quite different from the other schools in the district since you need to enroll in the 3-year-old lottery (a year before the main CPSD lottery). Tobin tends to be highly oversubscribed so slots are extremely competitive. However, since it is a separate lottery, if it is a program of interest, there is no downside to applying. Entering the program through the normal JK/K lottery is extremely rare; all or almost all of the slots are filled at the 3-year-old level. Last year, there were no slots available at the JK/K level.

Each classroom has a Montessori-trained teacher and an assistant teacher/aide. The principal, Jaime Frost, has been in that role for 2-3 years, and has been a part of the Tobin community for years, previously serving as the ELA specialist coach. 

The Tobin school day goes from 7:55 to 1:55. The 3 year old program runs from 7:55 to 11:55. There is an option for those children to stay until 1:55, Cub’s Corner, which offers nap time and care.  There is also an 3 year program in the Tobin Community School/After School, for children that need care until 5 pm. Also, note that 3-year-olds cannot ride the bus home, and must be dropped off and picked up by parents from the school. However, children can ride the bus once they turn 4.

The program is relatively young, and in the 2012-13 school year, all grades in the school (up to grade 5) transitioned to all Montessori classes. The building also houses the Vassal Lane Upper School campus, which draws students from the Graham and Parks School and the Haggerty School.

According to the parents we talked to, many of the founding community of parents (those who started when the program started 11 years ago) have aged out of the school. This understandably seems to be changing the community dynamics a bit but parents still find the school to be a very vibrant and active community of families.

The building is not one of the nicer or newer ones in the district. Over the years, families have been very involved in contributing to the effective learning environment (parents I spoke to described painting bathrooms, helping prepare classroom Montessori materials/manipulatives, etc.). The building is the next school slated for destruction and rebuilding by the district in 2020. Plans are still being defined so interested parents should be aware that students may be moved to a swing space unless the district makes other plans for the building.

The school is co-located with Vassal Lane Upper School (Tobin's upper school), so kids are in the same building from the time they are three years old through eighth grade. Tobin is located on the first floor, while Vassal Lane is on the second floor. The two schools don't really interact; they have different start times, lunch times, don't go out together. They do share a library, cafeteria, and gym, but those are used at different times by both groups. Sometimes kids might be on the same basketball court after school or similar but that's about all.

## General

### What do most parents say they like the most about your school?

* **Montessori method of teaching** with self-directed teaching and learning. Kids can learn effectively, develop a level of independence, and gain self-regulatory skills.
* **Mixed grade model**. Older kids are take leadership roles and teach younger kids and older kids learn from younger kids as well. Kids can learn at their own speed.
* **Active community.** There are Montessori and mindful workshops for parents on what the Montessori method is and what they can do at home to complement the classroom (ie,  independence of the child at home, how to encourage  your child do things for him/herself). Parents are encouraged to come into the classroom as room parents, to read to students, to talk about their work, culture, etc. Since the Montessori school began, parents have been very active in getting the community and school itself settled and started (including advocacy for programs, such as the Kodaly music program and math and ELA coaches, etc ). As the school and administration have settled in and fallen into a groove, the many needs for parent involvement seems to have lessened a bit, or so it feels to many parents who have been at the school for years (it's less necessary now that things are running smoothly).
* **Encouraging administration**  Tobin has a wonderful family liaison. She and the rest of the administration provide a lot of under-the-radar support for everyone. They set the tone of the welcoming community that it is. The [Cambridge Weekend Backpack program](http://www.foodforfree.org/tag/cambridge-weekend-backpack-program) was piloted at Tobin by Tobin parent and City Councilor [Alanna Mallon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alanna-mallon-635a3357/). Parents interviewed feel that there's a warm, encouraging environment from the Principal, assistant principal, teachers, and entire administration. It's a team effort, too (you'll see the assistant principal shoveling the sidewalk). 
* **Location** Right next to Fresh Pond. Nice playground. Lots of green space. Kids take field trips to Fresh Pond Reservation, where the might, for instance, draw birds and animals (and "going out" is part of the Montessori method).

### Are most families from the neighborhood or spread throughout Cambridge?

Because the school begins with 3 year olds, for equity’s sake, there is no proximity preference. The kids come from all over Cambridge. Since there is no longer the proximity preference, it does seem as if less parents hang out and stay on the playground (perhaps it feels like less of a neighborhood school).

### What are the afterschool options like?

* The school is co-located with the [Tobin Community School](https://www.cambridgema.gov/DHSP/programsforkidsandyouth/communityschools/tobincommunityschool). The Community School, is not a part of the Tobin school, but is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services.
* The Community School is available for the 3-year old program, and includes a program just for the 3 year olds. The afterschool takes a child to 5pm. 
* The Community School is great for grades JK-3, but it's a bit less attended for 4-5th grades. However, the [Russell Youth Center](http://www.cambridgema.gov/DHSP/ProgramsForKidsAndYouth/YouthCenterPrograms/RussellYouthCenter.aspx), also in West Cambridge, and other Youth Centers in the district provide great programming for 4th and 5th grades, including time for reading/homework, the cost is fairly inexpensive comparatively (and free for middle school). You can find out about the youth centers [here](http://www.cpsd.us/cms/one.aspx?portalId=3042869&pageId=5576095). 

Busing is utilized a fair bit. Other kids come to Tobin Community School for programs they like, and vice-versa. The parents I spoke to spoke highly of the [Maud Morgan Studio](http://www.maudmorganarts.org/) near Baldwin for older kids who are comfortable taking different buses to after schools thru out the district. But this is just one example of the options provided for kids who are interested in attending the different afterschools thru out the district.

The Tobin afterschool also runs a summer camp, with lots of beach trips, a pirate trip, swim lessons starting for older kids, etc. The parents I spoke with thought it was great for their kids when they were younger.

### How is conflict resolved if there is bullying or harassment?

The parents I spoke have not experienced bullying. They expected that the administration was well-attuned, however. Although they were clear that they could not speak for all students and families.

### How happy are families about the school, generally speaking? Any reasons for leaving? What are the most common problems parents give about your school?

The parents we talked were mostly very happy, but noted that the Montessori model may not be for every child, or family. And starting any program at age 3 has its challenges. In the older grades, as it goes throughout the district, some children leave for private schools for middle school, but not sure of the exact data on that. As with all schools in the district, turnover in students happens, simply because Cambridge is a transient place for many families; international families go back to home countries, families find Cambridge too expensive to stay, and so on.

### Tips for new families

* **Be prepared**. It's tough to come into a public school at 3 years old. It can also be logistically difficult for transportation (no bus until age 4). Tough to get kids in/out at that age. Kids have to be potty trained when they start the program at 3 (and as a policy, they can be asked to leave if they are not). And emotionally, sending a 3 year old to a school can be tough on all.
* **You should do your homework when it comes to understanding Montessori**. The method has different milestones. Just because kids get in early, that doesn't mean they'll be ahead of the game -- the early start is not there to be a genius production business, but to teach to the whole child.
* **There are options for afterschool care**, even at the 3-year-old level.
* **Don't worry too much**. The school knows how to address young kids' issues. Teacher aides will help 3-year-olds with lunch (e.g. to open containers), take them to bathroom, make sure winter clothing is on, etc. It's not daycare -- it's a big step up -- but there is support to make it work. 
* **Observe Children's House before coming in**. Contact the family liaison about a tour and observing the classrooms. Parents also have the opportunity to observe different classroom cohorts (from Children’s House to Lower Elementary to Upper Elementary) before children transition up to the next three-year (Lower El) year, or two- year (Upper El) cohort. . The transitions up are considered developmentally sound and the school really tries to prepare kids and families for those moves. There are parent/caretaker workshops to explain what happens in each transition. The parents we talked to encourage parents to take advantage of any sessions the school offers families.

## Academics

### How do you differentiate instruction by student? How are advanced learners handled (a few grade levels ahead)? Help for kids that are struggling/need help? How about special needs students (e.g. autism, dyslexia, etc.)? How common is it for students outside of the mainstream (in either direction) to transfer out of the school? How about different student interests? For example, if one student is very interested in biology, another in social justice, and a third in drawing…

As with the entire district, there are IEPs for students. Because the method is follow-the-child and mixed-grade, in theory it should differentiate to a range of backgrounds, abilities, and levels of learning. The math and language coaches and specialists are well respected and seem to do a good job of identifying kids who need extra support.

There are also clubs for special interests. There is:
* a Math Olympiad club (mostly 4th and 5th graders, but other ages have also been a part of the group)
* reading clubs/group; as well as
* enrichment programs in the afterschool.

### Aside from the math, English, science, and social studies, what does the class day include? What are the music, arts, world language, etc. programs.

* [Kodaly Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodály_method) through third grade, which was fund-raised by parents. The Kodaly program and the current teacher are fantastic, according the parents I talked to. In fourth grade, Kodaly ends, and kids learn the recorder, and in fifth grade, they pick an instrument. The Tobin Community School offers music lessons too.
* Spanish is offered in the afterschool
* A computer component starts in 3rd grade, where students get Chromebooks and work with Google Docs
* Library class and the library is well-utilized. It is shared with Vassal Lane Upper School, opens before school and closes a little after school. Friends of Tobin does a book fair to raise money for the library
* Gym twice a week

### How is the day broken down on academic versus non-academic time? How much recess is there? How much do kids play otherwise?

* There is one recess of 20 minutes per day (but it's guaranteed; the district policy is that teachers cannot take it away as a disciplinary measure).
* In cold weather, some classrooms go out and some don't. Especially the 3-year-olds are sometimes kept in (an assistant teacher helps get outdoor clothing on, but this is sometimes tough to do in practice with kids so little with limited time).
* A few teachers have mini-trampolines and yoga balls in classrooms, or allow their students to run around the school building, etc. 
* Kids have 20-25 minutes for lunch.
* There are snacks in classroom, but classrooms are very conscious of allergies. Most classrooms ask families to take turns supplying snacks for their children’s classroom. In some of the classrooms, the kids help serve the snacks (kids will cut up apples, set up tables, etc. etc.).

In contrast to traditional child care, the 3-year-olds don't really have playtime (dress up, etc). There is a lot of work on rugs on the floor; kids set up their own work mat and then set up materials. Again, families are encouraged to schedule a tour of the school to see how classrooms are set up. 

### How academically intense are the programs in grades 3-5?

It can depend on the classroom and your child. Socialization can be just as important as the academics. 

### Is there homework, and how much in each grade?

Tobin has gotten away from daily worksheets/homework. The kids do have some things to do at home:

* Research for projects
* Optional things for kids who ask (e.g. math portals online)
* Kids may be in the book group where they read books on specifics topics (e.g. interesting social issues, etc.)

### What role does MCAS play in the school and in curriculum design? What role does the Common Core play?

The program mostly follows the Montessori method but kids do spend time preparing for the format of test, Per district-wide policy, parents can opt their kids out.

As a public school, Tobin must follow the Common Core curriculum. There is some challenge between the Montessori model, which follows the skill level and interests of each individual child, and the standardization of Common Core and MCAS. Parents perceive that sometimes it is a challenge to integrate the two.

### What modes of instruction are dominant (e.g. lecture, projects, group work, etc.)

It varies by grade:
* 3-year-olds is about socialization, respect, courtesy, and coordination. You'll see things like moving pebbles with tongs, cleaning the classroom, or similar activities designed to prepare for the learning formats of the 4-year-old and 5-year-old. 
* JK/K has a lot of independent small group work at stations. Kids work with manipulatives. The math materials are self-correcting. The teachers are more of a guide and an observer. By 4th-5th grades (Upper Elementary), the classrooms are very collaborative. Recently, the Upper Elementary classes put on a wax figure museum. In this project, kids study Revolutionary War history by learning about specific personalities from the war. Then they spread out through school in costume and talk about their figures. The kids spent a whole trimester on doing their own research, including a school trip to Lexington/Concord, etc.

There is not a lot of lecture time. But the kids do meet together for:

* Circle time to start their day
* Self-directed work teams
* Monthly assemblies (presentation by one classroom)
* Music concerts

## Family Engagement

### Are parents welcome in classrooms? In the library?

Without being a distraction to their own child and others in the classroom, parents seem to be encouraged to come into the classroom and participate, especially in the younger classrooms. There are author celebrations where kids explain how they structured their writing and read aloud to other families who attend . There are math days, where students explain their math work to the other families from the classroom. There are parent breakfasts where kids show parents what they're working on.

### Does the school act as a community center? For example, do parents tend to organize birthday parties and other parent events at the school or somewhere else?

* It gets used for a lot of different things. Many groups rent the school on weekends (e.g. gym/baseball, African drumming group, church, etc.). Parents don't rent the space for birthday parties.
* The administration is open to school community uses. One couple organized a math club a few years ago. Some parents once organized a before-school fitness group for students in the gym. 
* Some parents and kids do hang out on the playground and fields -- it's a nice, great, big space.
* Parents also use school space for meetings.

### What's communications with parents like (mailings, parent-teacher conferences, etc.)?

The school does backpack express (ie, paper copies!)  for some families who don’t regularly communicate digitally. But most communications come through  email. The school communications used to be translated but parents were unsure if that was still happening. There are newsletters on Fridays. Teachers use [Signup Genius](http://www.jooners.com/) for parent-teacher conferences and alternative means such as sign up sheets outside classrooms. The principal sends a beginning-of-the-year/mid-year/etc. check-ins, as well as updates when specific things are happening. The school doesn't do texts, not much social media profile (although there is a Facebook page run by families). You might expect perhaps 2-3 emails per week total (maybe 2 from school, one from district).

### What’s the role of the school council? How often does the school council vote? How many members of the community typically attend meetings? Teacher council? How involved is the community in decision-making?

The School Advisory Council (SAC) has gone in waves of being well attended and less attended over the years. When the school was getting started, there were many decisions to be made, a lot of new policy, and parents were really involved in that process. Now, that the school is established and has a very dynamic and proactive administration, things are running pretty smoothly. The parents I spoke to hadn't been involved in the council in some time. The Friends of Tobin is very active and fundraises to support the school’s extracurricular programs and classroom needs. All that said, the principal is still working to involve all parents in the school. 

## How transparent is the school?

*The parents essentially edited this response in ways which didn't make sense (e.g. there was an editor's comment responding to a statement which was removed). In the interests of getting this text up, we removed it.*

### Community

## How friendly is the community? Do most parents know each other? How do the parents interact? What’s the best way to get to know other parents? Do families generally invite the whole class to birthday parties? How often do kids have playdates with classmates?

The parents I spoke to couldn't speak for younger grades, but at the time they came in, the community was one of the draws for them. There were plenty of opportunities for playdates and get-togethers for new families (the school organizes summer play dates around the city so that kids and families entering Tobin get to know each other. Tobin was on the first schools to start this and happy that other schools have now done the same). The community is very welcoming. The parents made an unofficial guide for parents starting at Tobin for new parents at one point, but now the school offers an official and very comprehensive version. The parents we spoke to suggested that parents are very present at the school in those first years, since the children are so young when they start. There are a lot of concerns when you start your child in school at 3. The logistics can seem a bit overwhelming. 

The impression I picked up was that there is still a robust community in younger grades as well, but since the parents I spoke were from older grades, they weren't too familiar with specifics; or if the dynamics have changed.

### How much time do parents spend in schools? How often do they come during pick up/drop-off?

Tobin is a magnet school so parents live all around Cambridge. There is much less activity at drop-off/pick-up and in the playground than there used to be when it was a neighborhood school. People used to hang out at drop-off, but that caused a huge traffic jam; the principal set up a live drop-off where the child leaves the car, is greeted and brought inside by the principal each morning, and parents drive off. Because of this well organized drop off, it's a bit harder to socialize, since the school makes drop off so convenient. 

### What’s the main channel of communication among parents (mailing list, forum, face-to-face?)

* Many families use Facebook
* Many email each other. There is a printed-out directory with emails if families Opt In to the School Directory.
* Personal interactions on the playground and around the school and school events

### What’s the role of the PTO? What does it do? How many active parents in the PTO?

* There is an annual trip for fourth/fifth grades that alternates between [Thompson Island](http://www.bostonharborislands.org/thompson-island) and [Nature's Classroom](http://www.naturesclassroom.org/Yarmouth.htm). This is part of the Montessori philosophy, and focuses on developing independence and team building. The parents we spoke to have had two children attend these trips and were positive about the experience. The school does a good job explaining the process to parents and preparing the kids. Friends of Tobin does fundraising to help support the trip. Much of the organization for the trip is done by the Lead Montessori Resource Teacher (a specialist who works with the teachers/administration/community as a whole, to make sure the Montessori methodology is followed in the context of a public school system). Families do pay some, but on the basis of who can afford what. Apparently, according to the kids, the food is great.
* Silent auction once a year
* Movie night once or twice a year
* Family picnic at the end of the summer (bouncing house, giant grill, etc.)
* Raise funds. Teachers can ask for supplementary funds for materials, field trips, etc. Advocated for Kodaly Music
* Selling swag
* ... And many of the other things listed above

## Do all the classes have room parents? Who is in charge of planning classroom events?

From 3-year-old through third grade, it's usually two room parents per classroom, sometimes three. The 4th/5h grade classrooms don't really have them. They organize classroom activities (e.g. classroom breakfasts), and organize parents to help make materials for use in the classrooms.

### How integrated is the school?

*The parents essentially edited this response in ways which didn't make sense in the context of the web site, essentially pointing to the plots just below on the district web site. We removed it.*
