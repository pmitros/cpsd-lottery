Tobin is the First Montessori-accredited public school in the United States. As a result, it operates quite differently from any of the other schools in the district. The Montessori Method of education is an approach which views the child as one who is naturally eager for knowledge and capable of initiating learning in a supportive, thoughtfully prepared learning environment. Children have a choice of activities from within a prescribed range of options and a fair degree of freedom and independence, with teachers acting as guides.

Tobin program places kids in mixed grade classrooms at three levels:

* Children's House: 3-year old, junior kindergarten, and kindergarten
* First through third grade
* Fourth and fifth grade (parents advocated for having this run through 6th grade, but haven't been successful yet)

Since students spend three years in the same classroom, students build a closer bond with their teachers and their peers (the school is also careful about how it assigns students into classrooms for good dynamics, and will move students if needed to get a good fit). A deep community forms around each classroom and there are fewer transitions. Classes tend to be pretty balanced by age as well (so a classroom will have approximately the same number of first-graders, second-graders, and third-graders) and kids learn from each other. To support this, the admissions model is quite different from the other schools in the district. To enroll in the program, kids enter a 3-year-old lottery a year before the main CPSD lottery. Tobin tends to be highly oversubscribed so slots are extremely competitive. However, since it is a separate lottery, if it is a program of interest, there is no downside to applying. Entering the program through the normal JK/K lottery tends to be extremely rare; all or almost all of the slots are filled at the 3-year-old level.

The program is relatively young; it started about a decade old. Prior to the Montessori program, Tobin was extremely under-subscribed, had serious issues (by 6th grade, it was down to just 13 kids), and not very socioeconomically diverse (middle class families didn't want their kids there). Montessori was brought in to address many of these issues and to bring in a more diverse set of parents. The program initially started in early grades, and expanded to higher grades as kids in the program grew older (with extensive parent advocacy). This process took some time (consider that the school started with non-Montessori teachers and assistant teachers). The school only recently moved out of the early experimental mode into a more stable mode of operation. The founding community is also in the process of leaving the school, with their kids moving onto the upper schools (although a few younger siblings remain). That's changing the dynamics of the school quite a bit in ways both good and bad.

Each classroom has a Montessori-trained teacher and an assistant teacher (the assistant necessarily Montessori-accredited). There is a new principal who has been in that role for 2-3 years, but before that, was the school's ELA specialist. The parent I spoke with had a high opinion of the principal, and said that the teachers were almost uniformly excellent (although, to be fair, most teachers in the district are). Many teachers came from private Montessori programs, and came to Tobin for the more diverse group of students (Tobin is one of the most diverse schools in the district).

The building is not one of the nicer ones in the district; it looks like a prison from the outside. The site also used to be a landfill, now capped and covered with three feet of topsoil. There is periodic EPA monitoring (and parents tend to be involved in monitoring too). The school community has done well with making it usable on the inside. When the school was young, the founding community was heavily involved in making it into an effective learning environment (the parent I spoke to described painting bathrooms, helping xerox and laminate Montessori materials, prepare manipulatives, etc. to get the classrooms setup). It's not too cluttered, there's adequate space (both inside and out -- Tobin has one of the larger fields outside), and it's pretty sunny, but it is not the school for parent looking for a state-of-the-art facility. The building is slated for destruction probably around 2020. The plans for that are still being defined but the administration is considering either moving kids into the temporary building where King Open is currently housed or building in the field by the school, and once that's done, replacing the original building with a field.

The school is co-located with Vassal Lane Upper School (which Tobin feeds into). Tobin is at the bottom, while Vassal Lane is on the upper story. The two schools don't really interact; they have different start times, lunch times, don't go out together. They do share a library, cafeteria, and gym, but those are used at different times by both groups. Sometimes kids might be on the same basketball court after school or similar but that's about all. There used to be problems (Vassal Lane kids had behavior issues at the start of the Innovation Agenda), but no longer. Still, kids are in the same building from the time they are three years old through eight grade.

## General

### What do most parents say they like the most about your school?

* **Montessori method of teaching** with self-directed teaching and learning. Kids learn effectively, develop high levels of independence, and gain better self-regulatory skills.
* **Mixed grade model**. Older kids are taking leadership roles and teaching younger kids. Teaching is a great way to learn.
* **Active community** There are classes/workshops for parents on what the Montessori method is and what they can do at home to complement in the classroom (a lot to stress the independence of the child at home -- and let child do things themselves). Parents are encouraged to come into the classroom and participate, especially in the younger classrooms. The parent group was really active when the school was getting started (including a lot of advocacy), but a bit less so now (it's less necessary now that things are running smoothly).
* **Encouraging administration** There's an awesome family liaison whose kids went to Tobin. She knows which families need help, and connects others to help them. There's a lot of under-the-radar support for everyone; poorer families are taken shopping at Target. The backpack program started there by [Alanna Mallon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alanna-mallon-635a3357/) and has now spread to every elementary school. There's a warm, encouraging environment from the Principal all the way down to the teachers, with kids cared for and feeling like they're part of the school. It's a team effort too (you'll see the assistant principal shoveling the sidewalk). There are a lot of different personalities -- some strict, some open, some shy, some gregarious -- but everyone loves the kids and the kids feel like they're cared for in a warm, supportive environment. 
* **Location** Right next to Fresh Pond. Nice playground. Lots of green space. Kids take field trips to Fresh Pond Reservation close by where the might, for instance, draw birds and animals (and "going out" is part of the Montessori method). 

### Are most families from the neighborhood or spread throughout Cambridge?

There is no proximity preference as of 5-6 years ago (magnet school) so the kids are very spread out now. There are just a few more kids from the area now (mostly since siblings of the kids from times when there was proximity preference still have priority). That has changed the community. Parents no longer pick up kids and stay on the playground so it's a bit harder to build that sense of community.

### What are the afterschool options like?

* The school has the [Tobin Community School](https://www.cambridgema.gov/DHSP/programsforkidsandyouth/communityschools/tobincommunityschool). The Community School has a homework center option, so kids can finish all homework before coming home.
* Community School is available for the 3-year old program as well, which would otherwise run 7:55-11:55. The afterschool takes it to 5pm and includes naptime ("Cub's Corner"). Note that 3-year-old cannot ride the bus home, and must be dropped off and picked up by parents from the school.
* The Community School is good for grades JK-3, but it's a bit weaker for 4-5. However, the [Russell Youth Center](https://www.cambridgema.gov/DHSP/programsforkidsandyouth/youthcenterprograms/russellyouthcenter.aspx) provides good programming for those grades, including time for reading/homework, and is much less expensive (and free for middle school). 

Early on the school had a lot of stay-at-home-moms, so the afterschool wasn't so utilized. Now, most families have two working parents, so most kids go, including 3-year-olds. 

Busing is utilized a fair bit. Other kids come to Tobin Community School for programs they like, and vice-versa. The parents I spoke to spoke highly of the [Maud Morgan Studio](http://www.maudmorganarts.org/) near Baldwin which integrates with the Baldwin afterschool (teachers walk kids over) as well as of sports programs at one of the other schools.

The afterschool also runs a summer camp, with lots of beach trips, a pirate trip, etc. It's pretty affordable. There's a concert at the end. Afterschool better for JK-3 than 4-5. But the community center really good for 4-5. Community center is free for middle schoolers, cheap otherwise.

### How is conflict resolved if there is bullying or harassment?

The parents I spoke have not experienced bullying; they had only heard of one instance in the school, but didn't know specifics. They expected the administration was well-attuned, however. 

They knew of one instance of "unkind words," which was handled swiftly. The assistant principal (Mr. Joey, of whom they also spoke highly), was very involved.

They had heard of kids switching classrooms when a particular group was not getting along well. 

### How diverse is the school staff? 

It's not that diverse -- mostly white women. The parents knew of just one male teacher. One factor is the school has to find Montessori-trained teachers, which limits the selection. 

### How happy are families about the school, generally speaking? Any reasons for leaving? What are the most common problems parents give about your school?

Most people are happy, but not every kid fits into the Montessori model; some kids need more structure. Some families took individual kids out of the program where it wasn't a good fit, but that wasn't dissatisfaction with the school (for example, families might take one sibling out, and keep another in). It's not for everyone; some kids find it hard to be self-directed in kindergarten. In the older grades, some parents plan to take child out for middle school and bring back for high school, and do that in fourth or fifth grade to do private school enrollment windows. There is a lot of turnover simply because Cambridge is a transient place for many families as well; international families go back to home countries, families find it too expensive to stay, or otherwise.

### Tips for new families

* Be prepared it's tough to come into a public school at 3 years old. It can also be logistically difficult for transportation (no bus until age 4). Tough to get kids in/out at that age. Kids also ought to be potty trained (they can be asked to leave if they are not; it's not common, but it's happened)
* You won't see evidence of learning right away. The first year or two is foundational stuff you might not pick up on as a parent: Writing grip. Manipulating small objects. Etc.
* You have to understand Montessori. The method has different milestones. Just because kids get in early, that doesn't mean they'll be ahead of the game -- the early start is not there to be a genius production business. It's a pretty subtle program
* There are options for afterschool care, even at the 3-year-old level
* Don't worry too much -- the school knows how to address issues for young kids. Teacher aides will help 3-year-olds with lunch (e.g. to open tupperware), take them to bathroom, make sure a coat is on going outside, etc. It's not daycare -- it's a big step up -- but there is support to make it work
* Go observe Children's House before coming in. They're flexible about observation. Observe 1-3 and 4-5 before kids go up to those grades too; the school encourages that. The transitions are big, but the school does a good job preparing kids and parents for them. There are parent workshops to explain what happens in transition. Take advantage of that. It's a big transition, but the kid is ready to get out at that point ("senioritis" in kindergarten).

## Academics

### How do you differentiate instruction by student?  How are advanced learners handled (a few grade levels ahead)?  Help for kids that are struggling/need help? How about special needs students (e.g. autism, dyslexia, etc.)?  How common is it for students outside of the mainstream (in either direction) to transfer out of the school? How about different student interests? For example, if one student is very interested in biology, another in social justice, and a third in drawing…

As with the entire district, there are IEPs for special needs students. The model works very well for some special needs, and not so well for others. Because the method is follow-the-child and mixed-grade, it fundamentally differentiates to different backgrounds, abilities, and levels of learning. It is not a good model for some specific disabilities, however. There were two children on the autism spectrum (who benefit from more structure). Those families transferred out. The math and language coaches have been very strong. They do a good job of identifying kids who need extra supports and delivering them. Such pull-outs are a lot less obtrusive because the classroom is free-flowing. It's not a distraction when a specialist works with a child or a child leaves the classroom, so overall, it's a pretty good fit for most special needs. The school has one set of specialists for 3-year-olds through 3rd grade and another set for 4th/5th grade. The parents I spoke to didn't know anything about the latter, but knew the former did a good job.

There are also clubs for advanced learners and special interests. There is a Math Olympiad club mostly for fifth-graders, but a first-grader attends too. Boys/girls clubs. Reading clubs/groups. There are enrichment programs in the afterschool.

### Aside from the math, English, science, and social studies, what does the class day include? What are the music, arts, world language, etc. programs.

* The school has [Kodaly Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kod%C3%A1ly_method) through third grade which was fundraised by parents and a few anonymous benefactors. In fourth grade, kids play the recorder. In fifth grade, kids pick an instrument. The Kodaly program is fantastic, but the 4th/5th grade ones are not all too robust. Kids don't really practice; you'll hear the same songs over-and-over: "Mary Had a Little Lamb" and "Tequila" (saying "Tortilla" instead of "Tequila"). The Tobin Community School has really good piano lessons. So the music program is really good and then not-so-good.
* There is art from grade three on up
* Spanish was eliminated in the Innovation Agenda, but is offered in the afterschool
* There is a computer component from 4th grade where students get Chromebooks and work with Google Docs
* There is a library class, and the library is well-utilized. It is shared with Vassal Lane Upper School, opens before school and closes a little after school. Friends of Tobin does a book fair to raise money for the library
* Gym is twice a week

Overall, the parents expressed an abstract wish for more art, foreign languages, etc., but understood that could not be fit into the school day without making it a bit too scattershot and appreciate the greater depth of having fewer programs.

### How is the day broken down on academic versus non-academic time? How much recess is there? How much do kids play otherwise? 

There is one recess of 20 minutes per day (but it's guaranteed; teachers can no longer take it away as a disciplinary measure). Kids have 20-25 minutes for lunch. There are snacks in classroom. In contrast to most schools where kids bring their own snacks, each week, one family in each classroom supplies the snacks. The kids then have a process where they serve snack (kids will cut up apples, set up tables, etc. etc.) A few teachers make up for the lack of recess by having things like mini-trampolines in classrooms, having kids run around the school building, yoga balls, or similar. One classroom has a rocker chair (just one, with an involved process for which child uses it when that the kids must manage). Teachers can ask for funds from Friends, and many of these in-classroom activities were funded this way. 

In contrast to child cares, the 3-year-olds don't really have playtime. They are learning life skills (e.g. kitchen time) and doing creative things, though (not lectures). There is a lot of work on rugs on the floor, and as with snack time, there is a deliberate way kids set up the mat and than materials on the mat. But there aren't things like dress-up time or other traditional childcare activities for the little kids. 

In cold weather, some classrooms go out and some don't. Especially the 3-year-olds are sometimes kept in (an assistant teacher helps get outdoor clothing on, but this is sometimes tough to do in practice with kids so little).

### How academically intense are the programs in grades 3-5?

It depends on the classroom. They've come along; it's more project-based, and the project-based work is starting to improve pretty quickly. It could be a little more intense in the projects, but kids came out pretty well prepared for 7th grade. Teachers in upper school could identify Montessori kids because the kids were more independent and self-motivated. Kids encouraged to do own planning. Better prepared. 

The upper grades have been around for maybe 4-5 years, so they've evolved quite a bit. No homework, but some research for projects at home. 

### Is there homework, and how much in each grade?

Tobin has gotten away from homework. The kids in older grades did sometimes have a lot of homework when they were in 1st-3rd, and it wasn't consistent but culture varied by teacher and classroom. Teachers would send home a weekly homework packet with worksheets and readings. Homework tended to be a little easier than classwork since it was expected there would be less support; the goal was to build confidence and to reinforce. Now, there is consistently no traditional homework (e.g. no worksheets or similar) per school policy. That standardization came as the school moved out of the experimental phase. The kids do have some things to do at home: 

* Research for projects
* Optional things for kids who ask (e.g. math portals online)
* Kids may be in the book group where they read books on specifics topics (e.g. interesting social issues, etc.)

### What role does MCAS play in the school and in curriculum design? What role does the Common Core play?

The role of the MCAS is not very significant. The program mostly follows the Montessori method. Kids do spend a little time preparing to format of test; they're used to doing math with manipulatives. They have some practice to understand how to take tests on paper and on a computer, and to reduce possible anxiety. In practice, most kids love the test days. It gives a chance to do something different, and it's really depressurized at the school. Parents I spoke to said their kids didn't care about the tests at all, but reported that the kids of some of the other parents did (but kids with test anxiety can opt out, take it in their own time, or have lots of other means to manage it). 

As a public school, Tobin also follows the Common Core curriculum. Montessori gives materials and a prepared environment where kids learn on their own to kids in a self-directed fashion based on their own interests. There is some tension between the Montessori model, which follows the skill level and interests of each individual child and versus the standardization of Common Core and standardized test formats (with their associated pressure to teach-to-the-test, give practice exams, etc.), and it is sometimes a little difficult to integrate the two. The model is slightly hybridized from traditional Montessori schools to adapt to district requirements, but for the most part, leans more closely to Montessori than to standardized education.

Given the lack of emphasis on MCAS and Common Core, parents were surprised how well the school did on the MCAS. It over-performed the district average despite the lack of alignment with the mainstream educational model the MCAS is designed around.

Teachers also do steer kids into areas they otherwise won't go into (so one kid won't learn just math and another just reading).

### What modes of instruction are dominant (e.g. lecture, projects, groupwork, etc.)

It varies by grade:

* 3-year-olds is about socialization, respect, courtesy, and coordination. Kids moving pebbles with tongs, clean the classroom, and generally prepare for the learning formats of the 4-year-old and 5-year-old. *Editor's note: JK was originally brought into the district by Graham and Parks precisely to give kids a chance to adapt to the format of schools. It lead to improved student outcomes and so spread district-wide.*
* JK/K has independent small group work at stations. Kids work a lot with manipulatives. The math materials are self-correcting. The teachers are more of a guide and an observer. They'll teach kids how to work with the materials.
* As per the Montessori method, older kids move away from manipulatives towards handling mathematical concepts more abstractly. It also becomes more of a hybrid and not strict traditional Montessori in higher grades in some ways. It's not lecture, but there is a move towards more groupwork, projects, and social studies.

We discussed a bit about how kids learned math, and the parent described [multiplication boards](https://www.amazon.com/Kid-Advance-Montessori-Multiplication-Board/dp/B0043B2EAG), where kids place beads to understand how to multiply, and similar objects. The biggest manipulative is a 100 x 100 x 100 million cube. The parents' impression was that kids didn't learn math as fast, but they got there ultimately with a richer and deeper understanding of the concepts. 

By 3rd-5th grades, the classrooms are very collaborative together. One major project is the wax figure museum. In this project, kids study Revolutionary War history by learning about specific personalities from the war. Then they spread out through school in costume and talk about their figures. They spent a whole trimester on that; the kids did research, went to Lexington/Concord, etc. 

There is not a lot of lecture. The only times kids sit around listening are:

* Circle time every day
* Monthly assemblies (presentation by one classroom)
* Concerts (which are quite good). 

## Family Engagement

### Are parents welcome in classrooms? In the library?

Very much so -- the school tries to bring the family in. Parents are encouraged to come into the classroom and participate, especially in the younger classrooms.  There are author celebrations where kids explain stories they're writing to parents. There are parent breakfasts where kids show parents what they're working on. Parents come into classrooms to read stories, talk about work, or otherwise. The school tries to bring the family in. 

### Does the school act as a community center? For example, do parents tend to organize birthday parties and other parent events at the school or somewhere else?

It gets used for a lot of different things, but most have nothing to do with the school. Many groups rent the school on weekends (e.g. gym/baseball, African drumming group, church, etc.). Parents don't rent the space for birthday parties. But the administration is open to it. One couple organized a math club a few years ago (but has since moved to Europe). Some parents once organized a before-school fitness group for kids. It's just that no one is really doing it right now. 

Some parents and kids hang out on the playground and fields -- it's a nice, great, big space. Parents also do use school space for meetings. 

### What's communications with parents like (mailings, parent-teacher conferences, etc.)?

The school will do backpack express for families who want it and email for everyone else. The school communications are translate into native languages for families of different languages by volunteers. There are newsletter on Fridays. Teachers have [Signup Genius](http://www.jooners.com/) for parent-teacher conferences (and other means for less tech-savvy parents -- e.g. sign up sheets outside classrooms). The principal send a beginning-of-the-year/mid-year/etc. check-ins, as well as update when specific things are going on. It's not very high tech; the school doesn't have texts, not much social media profile (although there is a Facebook page run by families). You might expect perhaps 2-3 emails per week total (maybe 2 from school, one from district). 

### What’s the role of the school council? How often does the school council vote? How many members of the community typically attend meetings? Teacher council? How involved is the community in decision-making?

The school advisory council went from being robust to being not very robust. The need approve the school's discretionary budget. When the school was getting started, there were many decisions to be made, a lot of new policy, and parents were really involved in that. Now, the school is established, things are running pretty smoothly, so there is much less need. The parents I spoke to hadn't paid attention to the council in some time but recalled when they did much more. The Friends group is also fairly new, so many of its functions were handled by the council before it formed. There was also a family outreach council (which the principal attended as well usually) which organized room parents and organized volunteers to help cut out materials and laminate them, but with the Friends group (and many materials made), that's obsolete. Many of the more active families who were pivotal in founding the program have also left the school. The parent said they used to elect council members (with the unit of voting a family rather than a particular parent), but now it seems to be the same set of parents every year. The school is also on its third principal, and the current one is very proactive. Previously, the principal relied on families to bring up issues. Now, issues tend to be addressed early enough that there isn't much need for the council. The previous principal was also far less transparent, so parents needed to be involved to get information. Now it's proactively emailed to everyone. She's working to get people back involved. 

### How transparent is the school?

There have been issues and teachers are cautioned on what they say in some areas, but overall, the parents I spoke with felt it was pretty transparent and they never had problems getting information they needed. If issue in classroom, the teacher sends an email, cc:ing the principal (school communicates at the level of issues such as: a little kid getting upset and yelling, kids not nice to art teacher, kid getting on the wrong bus, etc.). 

*Editor's note: Some schools in CPSD have extreme transparency issues. Based on the conversation, Tobin felt more transparent than most. It's just that the parents I spoke with were more aware of the sometimes subtle issues around transparency.*

## Community

### How friendly is the community? Do most parents know each other? How do the parents interact? What’s the best way to get to know other parents? Do families generally invite the whole class to birthday parties? How often do kids have playdates with classmates?

The parents I spoke to couldn't speak for younger grades, but at the time they came in, the community was one of the draws for parents. There were quite a few big parties, a lot of playdates, and the community was very welcoming. The parents made an unofficial guide for parents starting at Tobin for new parents. At the time, there were more parents hanging out at playground, but less so now without proximity preference. Most of the friends they made, they made by hanging out in at Tobin in the olden days, but they did meet people at movie nights and other events. It was very welcoming.

The impression I picked up was that there is still a robust community in younger grades as well, but since the parent I spoke were from older grades, they weren't too familiar with specifics; the dynamics clearly changed a lot.

### How much time do parents spend in schools? How often do they come during pick up/drop-off?

Tobin is a magnet school so parents live all around Cambridge. There is much less activity at drop-off/pick-up and in the playground than there used to be when it was a neighborhood school. People used to hang out at drop-off, but that caused a huge traffic jam; the principal set up a live drop-off where the child leaves the car and parents drive off. As such, it's a bit harder to socialize. A few of the local parents still walk in, but not as many. In the olden days, parents used to hang out and talk for an hour after drop-off in the "family pod," have monthly parent coffees, etc., but that's mostly gone. There is still a strong community, but that's not how it manifests.

The parents did comment, again, that they were less in touch with the earlier grades. 

### What’s the main channel of communication among parents (mailing list, forum, face-to-face?)

* A lot of families use Facebook
* Many email each other. There is a printed-out directory with emails (and just copying old email addresses from other class-wide mailings)
* Some mouth-to-mouth on the playground

### What’s the role of the PTO? What does it do? How many active parents in the PTO? 

* There is an annual trip for fourth/fifth grades which alternates between [Thompson Island](http://www.bostonharborislands.org/thompson-island) and [Nature's Classroom](http://www.naturesclassroom.org/Yarmouth.htm). This is part of the Montessori "going out" method, and focuses on developing independence and team building. The kids love it. You can opt out, but they do a good job explaining the process to parents (some parents are concerned; it's the first time kid away that long): They explain where kids will sleep, bathroom facilities, etc. Some kids are sometimes worried going in too, but they came back with great shared experience with friends from the other classroom. Friend of Tobin does fundraising for that, and much of the organization is done by the Montessori resource teacher (a specialist who works with the main teachers to make sure the Montessori methodology is followed and helps bridge it to a public school setting). Families do pay some, but on the basis of who can afford what. The food is great. 
* Silent auction once a year
* Movie night once a year
* Family picnic at the end of the summer (bouncing house, giant grill, etc.)
* Raise funds. Teachers can ask for supplementary funds for materials, field trips, etc. One classroom goes to see Jose Mateo's nutcracker. 
* Advocated for Kodaly Music
* Selling swag
* ... And many of the other things listed above

### Do all the classes have room parents? Who is in charge of planning classroom events?

From 3-year-old through third grade, it's usually two room parents per classroom, sometimes three. The 4th/5h grade classrooms don't really have them. They organize classroom activities (e.g. classroom breakfasts), and organize parents to help make materials for use in the classrooms.

### How integrated is the school? 

The younger grades are very integrated, but the older kids do segregate on race, gender, socioeconomic status, and neighborhood. Families from some communities don't do playdates so it's hard to establish the connection. Some families don't have an English speaker at home, so it's even harder. One religion doesn't do birthday parties. The kids are sometimes still friends, but it's a bit harder for them to get to know each other well.
