Originally named after [Louis Agassiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Agassiz), the Baldwin school was [renamed](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2002/5/22/committee-renames-local-agassiz-school-the/) in 2002 after Maria Baldwin. It has strong ties to the Harvard/[Agassiz](http://agassiz.org/) community. It has [before school activities](http://baldwin.cpsd.us/activities/before_school_clubs) in addition to the [normal afterschool programs](http://agassiz.org/childrens-programs/). 

In recent years, it has tended to be one of the more heavily subscribed schools in the district, but most students who list it first still tend to make it in.

We were able to interview a parent from Baldwin fairly briefly. Most of our interviews were with highly engaged parents. We were unable to find someone at Baldwin able to schedule such an interview. A Baldwin parent agreed to speak to us briefly before they put their child to bed. In contrast to the other schools, this was a person from our social network (who, in essence, dropped their child off and picked them up from school without engaging further). As a consequence, this interview is a little bit sparse. It also happened just before the lottery, so it's a little bit late. Our apologies.

## General

### What do most parents say they like the most about your school?

* High level of parent involvement and community engagement
* Quality of teachers is very high

### Are most families from the neighborhood or spread throughout Cambridge?

It's a mix. There is a fair number of walkers, but overall, it is pretty spread out.

### What are the afterschool options like?

* The [Maud Morgan](http://www.maudmorganarts.org/) up the street
* There is some before-school programming starting at 8, while the school starts at 8:40. The parent we spoke to didn't participate. More generally, kids can arrive early and hang out in the cafeteris
* There are other options as well (which the parent wasn't familiar with, but which we found online): [The Baldwin Afterschool](http://agassiz.org/childrens-programs/afterschool-1-5-program/) and the 

### How is conflict resolved if there is bullying or harassment?

Didn't know

### How diverse is the school staff? 

A majority women, but there are a few men. There was a male teacher in both the third grade and in JK. Many are white, but not all. 

### How happy are families about the school, generally speaking? Any reasons for leaving? What are the most common problems parents give about your school?

Generally, familes were very happy, and the parent we spoke with hadn't heard of reasons for leaving or major problems. The school prides itself on being well-run and well-maintained. It has a new principal this year.

There is a significant amount of teacher turnover, but not of an unhealthy kind. The teachers who left were moving up in their careers (not leaving dissatisfied) -- a positive sign about Baldwin.

### Tips for new families

* Encourage kids to ride the bus. Don't drive them. It's a good step towards independence.

## Academics

### How do you differentiate instruction by student?  How are advanced learners handled (a few grade levels ahead)?  Help for kids that are struggling/need help? How about special needs students (e.g. autism, dyslexia, etc.)?  How common is it for students outside of the mainstream (in either direction) to transfer out of the school? How about different student interests? For example, if one student is very interested in biology, another in social justice, and a third in drawing…

The parent wasn't very aware of how this was managed, but was aware of periodic assessments of e.g. reading level. As with most schools, kids who were behind were pulled out to work with specialists, and the timing of the pullouts varied (but never at recess or at lunch). 

### Aside from the math, english, science, and social studies, what does the class day include? What are the music, arts, world language, etc. programs.

* Art once a week (but for a full hour)
* Gym twice a week
* Music three times a week
* Library once a week
* Technology in library

### How is the day broken down on academic versus non-academic time? How much recess is there? How much do kids play otherwise? 

* Recess once a day
* A bit of choice time in the classroom

### How academically intense are the programs in grades 3-5?

The parent didn't know.

### Is there homework, and how much in each grade?

Starting in first grade, there is a weekly homework packet. It seemed pretty brief.

As with all schools, there is reading (20 minutes per day). 

### What role does MCAS play in the school and in curriculum design? What role does the Common Core play?

Parent didn't know. 

### What modes of instruction are dominant (e.g. lecture, projects, groupwork, etc.)

Parent didn't know. Guessed some combination.

## Family Engagement

### Are parents welcome in classrooms? In the library?

Fair number of opportunities to participate, but it's not really open in the sense of parents walking in and hanging out. Parents do come in and volunteer in classrooms for specific activities. The parent described being invited to help with math stations and with a crystal growing activity (but didn't do so). There are occasional breakfasts to see what kids are doing too. So there are structured ways to participate.

In kindergarten, parents do hang out a little bit in classrooms at drop-off. In first grade, kids go directly into a structured activity, and it's very orderly. 

### Does the school act as a community center? For example, do parents tend to organize birthday parties and other parent events at the school or somewhere else?

The parent I spoke to didn't think so, but was not in neighborhood so didn't know whether there might be more of that for local families. The families who do live in the neighborhood tend to know each other better, while the families of kids who come in on a bus don't know each other as well. 

There are neighborhood events there as well from the Agassiz-Baldwin (e.g. a Thanksgiving meal), but those are more for community residents than for school families.

### What's communications with parents like (mailings, parent-teacher conferences, etc.)?

Family liaision is amazing. Communicates mainly by email at least once a week (every Friday a roundup of things which are happening in the school, upcoming Cammbridge community events, etc.). Emails from room parents. Occasionally from the teacher. Everything in email also comes in on paper.

There are no robocalls or SMSes (only from the district), no online forums, no apps, etc.

### What’s the role of the school council? How often does the school council vote? How many members of the community typically attend meetings? Teacher council? How involved is the community in decision-making?

The parent didn't know, but commented on being invited all the time. 

### How transparent is the school?

The parent didn't know. There are principal coffees.

## Community

### How friendly is the community? Do most parents know each other? How do the parents interact? What’s the best way to get to know other parents? Do families generally invite the whole class to birthday parties? How often do kids have playdates with classmates?

Fair amount of friendliness, but it's easier for parents physically at the school to have that. Parents wait as a herd outside. Some invite whole class, some don't. Pretty good split. Invited to a few which were everybody. 

### How much time do parents spend in schools? How often do they come during pick up/drop-off?

Parents are welcome in the school, but most don't really hang out at drop-off and pick-up. After school, there is an element of playground from neighborhood parents.

All-school meetings are well-attended and occasional other special events in the evening. A few in-class activiites. A lot fo engagement from some parents.

8:30-9:30 breakfast, most kids there. Most parents come when invited. 

### What’s the main channel of communication among parents (mailing list, forum, face-to-face?)

Not too much. E-mail. 

School-wide LISTSERV, used a little bit. 

### What’s the role of the PTO? What does it do? How many active parents in the PTO? 

A lot of fundraising for class trips and things like that. Didn't know specifics. 

### Do all the classes have room parents? Who is in charge of planning classroom events?

I think so. The events are a collaboration between room parents and teachers. Teachers want to accomplish something, and parents facilitate that. 

### How integrated is the school? 

In kindergarten, very integrated, maybe
