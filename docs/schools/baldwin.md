Originally named after [Louis Agassiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Agassiz), the Baldwin school was [renamed](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2002/5/22/committee-renames-local-agassiz-school-the/) in 2002 after Maria Baldwin. It has strong ties to the Harvard/[Agassiz](http://agassiz.org/) community. It has [before school activities](http://baldwin.cpsd.us/activities/before_school_clubs) in addition to the [normal afterschool programs](http://agassiz.org/childrens-programs/). 

In recent years, it has tended to be one of the more heavily subscribed schools in the district, but most students who list it first still tend to make it in.
