Originally named after [Louis Agassiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Agassiz), the Baldwin school was [renamed](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2002/5/22/committee-renames-local-agassiz-school-the/) in 2002 after Maria Baldwin. It's helpful to keep both names in mind, since many of the community (and many supporting organizations) use one name, the other, or both. For example, it has strong ties to the [Agassiz Baldwin Community](http://agassiz.org/ organization which runs its [normal afterschool programs](http://agassiz.org/childrens-programs/). 

In recent years, it has tended to be one of the more heavily subscribed schools in the district, but most students who list it first still tend to make it in.

**Most of our interviews were scheduled through Friends organizations and similar, so had highly knowledgeable parents. We were unable to find someone from Baldwin and schedule an interview in time for the 2018 school lottery. In late January, we spoke with a parent from one of our social groups from a Baldwin family. The discussion was quite brief, and the parent didn't know much about the school (they had never really interacted with the Friends organization, school council, or participated in the school community too much). That doesn't reflect poorly on the school community; most schools have a highly engaged core and a periphery. We weren't able to engage with anyone from the core at Baldwin, and as a consequence, this interview is quite cursory.

We're still looking for someone to interview to go into more depth (even past the lottery date). If you're a parent at the school and would like to be interviewed about your experience, please [contact us](mailto:beccax@gmail.com) with general availability for a call (school hours, after kids go to bed, etc.).**

## General

### What do most parents say they like the most about your school?

* High level of parent involvement and community engagement
* Quality of teachers is very high

### Are most families from the neighborhood or spread throughout Cambridge?

It's a mix. There is a fair number of walkers, but overall, it is pretty spread out.

### What are the afterschool options like?

* The [Maud Morgan](http://www.maudmorganarts.org/) is up the street and highly regarded district-wide
* There are some [before school activities](http://baldwin.cpsd.us/activities/before_school_clubs) (the school starts at 8:40), and kids are also welcome to just arrive early and hang out in the cafeteris
* There Agassiz Baldwin community runs the [The Baldwin Afterschool](http://agassiz.org/childrens-programs/afterschool-1-5-program/), which is quite different from the normal DHSP offerings at other schools.

### How is conflict resolved if there is bullying or harassment?

The parent didn't know.

### How diverse is the school staff? 

A majority women, but there are a few men -- there was a male teacher in both the third grade (one of three) and in JK (one of five). This ratio, while extremely skewed, still sounded more balanced them some schools. Many are white, but not all. 

### How happy are families about the school, generally speaking? Any reasons for leaving? What are the most common problems parents give about your school?

Generally, familes are very happy, and the parent we spoke with hadn't heard of reasons for leaving or major problems (but, again, did not know many families in the school). The school prides itself on being well-run and well-maintained.

There is a significant amount of teacher turnover, but not of an unhealthy kind. The teachers who left were moving up in their careers, rather than leaving dissatisfied -- Baldwin was a place where teachers could develop and progress. It also has a new principal this year.

### Tips for new families

* Encourage kids to ride the bus. Don't drive them. It's a good step towards independence.

## Academics

### How do you differentiate instruction by student?  How are advanced learners handled (a few grade levels ahead)?  Help for kids that are struggling/need help? How about special needs students (e.g. autism, dyslexia, etc.)?  How common is it for students outside of the mainstream (in either direction) to transfer out of the school? How about different student interests? For example, if one student is very interested in biology, another in social justice, and a third in drawing…

The parent wasn't very aware of how this was managed, but was aware of periodic assessments of e.g. reading level. As with most schools, kids who were behind were pulled out to work with specialists. At Baldwin, the timing of the pullouts varied (but never at recess or at lunch). 

### Aside from the math, english, science, and social studies, what does the class day include? What are the music, arts, world language, etc. programs.

* Art once a week (but for a full hour)
* Gym twice a week
* Music three times a week
* Library once a week
* Technology in library

### How is the day broken down on academic versus non-academic time? How much recess is there? How much do kids play otherwise? 

* Recess once a day
* A bit of choice time in the classroom

### How academically intense are the programs in grades 3-5?

The parent didn't know.

### Is there homework, and how much in each grade?

Starting in first grade, there is a weekly homework packet. It seemed pretty pretty brief.

As with all schools, there is reading (20 minutes per day). 

### What role does MCAS play in the school and in curriculum design? What role does the Common Core play?

The parent didn't know.

### What modes of instruction are dominant (e.g. lecture, projects, groupwork, etc.)

The parent didn't know, and guessed it was some combination.

## Family Engagement

### Are parents welcome in classrooms? In the library?

There are a fair number of opportunities to participate, but it's not really open in the sense of parents walking in and hanging out at the school or in the classrooms (as one might find at FMA, Cambridgport, or G&P). Parents do come in and volunteer in classrooms for specific teacher-suggested activities. The parent described being invited to help with math stations and with a crystal growing activity (but couldn't do so with work commitments, so couldn't describe those in greater depth). There are occasional breakfasts to see what kids are doing too. So there are structured ways to participate.

In kindergarten, parents do hang out a little bit in classrooms at drop-off. In first grade, kids go directly into a structured activity and it's very orderly. 

### Does the school act as a community center? For example, do parents tend to organize birthday parties and other parent events at the school or somewhere else?

The parent I spoke to didn't think so, but did not live in neighborhood so didn't know whether there might be more of that for local families. The families who do live in the neighborhood tend to know each other better, while the families of kids who come in on a bus don't know each other as well. 

There are neighborhood events there as well from the Agassiz-Baldwin (e.g. a Thanksgiving meal), but those are more for community residents than for school families.

### What's communications with parents like (mailings, parent-teacher conferences, etc.)?

Family liaision is amazing. Communicates mainly by email at least once a week (every Friday a roundup of things which are happening in the school, upcoming Cammbridge community events, etc.). Emails from room parents. Occasionally from the teacher. Everything in email also comes on paper in backpacks.

There are no robocalls or SMSes (only from the district), no online forums, no apps, etc.

### What’s the role of the school council? How often does the school council vote? How many members of the community typically attend meetings? Teacher council? How involved is the community in decision-making?

The parent didn't know, but commented on being invited all the time. 

### How transparent is the school?

The parent didn't know. There are principal coffees.

## Community

### How friendly is the community? Do most parents know each other? How do the parents interact? What’s the best way to get to know other parents? Do families generally invite the whole class to birthday parties? How often do kids have playdates with classmates?

Fair amount of friendliness, but it's easier for parents in the neighborhood physically dropping off and picking up to have that kind of community.

Regarding birthdays, there's a pretty good split of who invites the whole class and who doesn't.

### How much time do parents spend in schools? How often do they come during pick up/drop-off?

Parents are welcome in the school, but most don't really hang out at drop-off and pick-up at the school, although after school, many of the neighborhood parents do spend some time at the playground.

All-school meetings are well-attended and there are occasional other special events in the evening. As mentioned, there are some in-class activiites as well (the breakfasts, in particular, are 8:30-9:30 breakfast and most parents come to them). The parent said there was a lot of engagement from some of the parents.

### What’s the main channel of communication among parents (mailing list, forum, face-to-face?)

Not too much. Parents e-mail each other a bit. There is a school-wide LISTSERV, but it's only used a little bit. 

### What’s the role of the PTO? What does it do? How many active parents in the PTO? 

A lot of fundraising for class trips and things like that. The parent didn't know specifics. 

### Do all the classes have room parents? Who is in charge of planning classroom events?

The parent thought so, and said that classroom events were a collaboration between room parents and teachers. Teachers want to accomplish something, and the parents helped facilitate that. 

### How integrated is the school? 

The parent wasn't really sure; they thought in kindergarten it was very integrated, and didn't know about higher grades.
