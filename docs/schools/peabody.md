Peabody is a school in North Cambridge, in the Alewife area. This area has many families and not so many schools, so Peabody tends to be heavily oversubscribed. Odds of making it in without proximity points are essentially zero -- in the 2017 lottery, there were 75 students with priority points for 45 slots.
