Peabody is a school in North Cambridge, in the Alewife area. This area has many families and not so many schools, so Peabody tends to be heavily oversubscribed. Odds of making it in without proximity points are essentially zero -- in the 2017 lottery, there were 75 students with priority points for 45 slots.

## General

### What do most parents say they like the most about your school?

There's a strong sense of community. It's the only school in the area, and it's a real community school. Kids walk to school together -- there's a big train of parents and kids. Parents pick up each others' children when something comes up. The school and the O-Neill Library are in the same building, and it's right next to a few parks, so it's a real community center. A lot of people are involved in both the community and the school. 

### Are most families from the neighborhood or spread throughout Cambridge?

Almost all families are from the neighborhood.

### What are the afterschool options like?

There are two programs, the [city-run afterschool program](https://www.cambridgema.gov/DHSP/programsforkidsandyouth/Afterschool/peabodyk2afterschool) which is pretty unstructured and the [Fitzgerald Community School](https://www.cambridgema.gov/DHSP/programsforkidsandyouth/communityschools/fitzgeraldcommunityschool) which has lots of structured activities. Most kids are in one of the afterschool programs, and I understood in the latter, which has many different options for activities. Kids from both do intermingle. 

### How is conflict resolved if there is bullying or harassment?

The parent I spoke to did not know since his children had not experienced it yet. He knew the teacher and principal would get involved and there is an anti-bullying initiative. He had heard of one incident where the child needed to sit in principal's office.

### How diverse is the school staff? 

It's not diverse enough; it's heavily skewed towards white women. The racial imbalance is acknowledged as a problem, and is one of the key topics in discourse between the parents and the administration. The administration is pretty white as well.

### How happy are families about the school, generally speaking? Any reasons for leaving? What are the most common problems parents give about your school?

Most parents are very happy, and the only major reason for leaving is moving. Kids do transfer in from the waitlist as spots open up.

The major concerns are:

* Parents want more recess time
* Lack of diversity among the staff and administration

*Editor's note: Recess-time is a district-wide issue. Parents at Peabody are more vocal about it, but it comes up in most schools.*

### Tips for new families

[I forgot to ask this question]

## Academics

### How do you differentiate instruction by student?  How are advanced learners handled (a few grade levels ahead)?  Help for kids that are struggling/need help? How about special needs students (e.g. autism, dyslexia, etc.)?  How common is it for students outside of the mainstream (in either direction) to transfer out of the school? How about different student interests? For example, if one student is very interested in biology, another in social justice, and a third in drawing…

The parent I spoke with had some experience with students on IEPs and knew one child who was in physical therapy. The school proactively identified the student need, and the program worked very well, with the child showing significant improvement. The parent also mentioned that speech therapy worked pretty well. 

Differentiation is teacher-specific. In first grade, 3-4 advanced readers were pulled out and had readings at their own level.

The district handles kids who are behind through interventions by specialists. The school just lost some Title 9 funding so the school went from a full-time reading specialist in second grade to a half-time reading specialist, which may not be enough. 

### Aside from the math, English, science, and social studies, what does the class day include? What are the music, arts, world language, etc. programs.

* Blown away by the [Kodaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kod%C3%A1ly_method) music program. The kids have music four days a week. They do a concert twice a year for all the grades. In the kindergarten concert, the five-year-olds learned and performed ten songs. In third grade, every kid gets a recorder. Around four grade, there are regular instruments and band. The kids learn a lot! The parent described Peabody as "the music school."
* There is art one day a week. Parents want more art :)
* PE twice a week
* Library is once a week. One of the public library branches is attached to the school, which helps. One library might have story-time while kids in the other library might be doing homework, for example.

### How is the day broken down on academic versus non-academic time? How much recess is there? How much do kids play otherwise? 

Recess is 20 minutes per day. Of that, give minutes is spent coming and going, so there is perhaps 15 minutes on time on the playground. Lunch is about 20 minutes as well, and the school definitely needs more unstructured time. Playtime otherwise is teacher-specific. There is choice time in kindergarten, but that declines in higher grades. One of the second grade teacher reads a lot, which kids enjoy, but which isn't quite the same as creative free-play.

*Editor's note: 20 minutes of recess is pretty common district-wide.*

### How academically intense are the programs in grades 3-5?

The parent I interviewed did not know.

### Is there homework, and how much in each grade?

This is teacher-specific:

* One of the first grade assigns a worksheet of homework each day and the other one does not
* One second grade teacher assigns classwork, and if kids don't finish it, they need to finish at home (but parent reported their child never needed to do anything at home). She also occasionally sends home lists of [sight words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_education_in_the_United_States#Whole_Word). The other second grade teacher does assign a bit.
* There is more homework in higher grades. One child the parent knew had homework over the snow break (at the time of the interview, the school had recently had a four-day weekend due to an excessive snow fall).

### What role does MCAS play in the school and in curriculum design? What role does the Common Core play?

The parent did not know. The parent did say there is a parent advocacy group at Peabody working to try to be able to opt their kids out of standardized testing.

### What modes of instruction are dominant (e.g. lecture, projects, group-work, etc.)

It's more lecture-based than project-based, but this is specific to the teacher. First grade had a bit more project-based learning than second grade, and it sounded like higher grades tended towards more traditional formats.

## Family Engagement

### Are parents welcome in classrooms? In the library?

Parents are invited to come in if they choose to. In younger grades, families come in to talk about their families and their cultures. Parents come in to read to the kids in the younger grades as well. There is an all-school-share once a month.

In practice, most parents don't have time to participate in many such events, so you don't see parents in classrooms everyday, but the parent I spoke to never felt unwelcome, and said all their friends had gone in at least once at some point. There were more parents in classrooms with younger kids, but one parent taught fifth graders about circuits and electronics.

### Does the school act as a community center? For example, do parents tend to organize birthday parties and other parent events at the school or somewhere else?

Birthday parties generally weren't at the school, but it is a community hub for the Fitzgerald community. Kids play in the school and adjoining park playgrounds. The community library is there. The school conducts flu shots for kids in the winter. There is a community market and free food occasionally. Parents walk together to school, hang out after pickup, and kids play in the playground.

Many families who live in the area but don't send their kids to Peabody hang out with the school community too. 

### What's communications with parents like (mailings, parent-teacher conferences, etc.)?

The school tends to over-communicate rather than under-communicate. Parents will get at least 1-2 per day from the administration about school happenings and events. Teachers sometimes email, but most parents also see teachers at drop-off and sometimes at pickup, so much of that interaction is face-to-face. 

### What’s the role of the school council? How often does the school council vote? How many members of the community typically attend meetings?  How involved is the community in decision-making?

The parent I spoke to wasn't familiar with what happened at the school council, but there is a second group called Connections which plays a similar role. It's not an elected body (all parents are welcome to participate equally), and it meet 1x-2x a month to talk to the administration. That's the major voice for parents, and the administration listens well.

The parent I spoke with did not have experience with how much the administration responds, or how much that dialog feeds into school policy, but it was clear there was a dialog. 

### How transparent is the school?

Teachers seem welcome to talk openly, and the parent I spoke with was unaware of any issues.

## Community

### How friendly is the community? Do most parents know each other? How do the parents interact? What’s the best way to get to know other parents? Do families generally invite the whole class to birthday parties? How often do kids have playdates with classmates?

There's a really strong sense of local community, and it's an easy and welcoming community to become a part of. The parent I spoke to met many people in the community when their kids started going to skill. Live in a tight-nit neighborhood; even kids not in Peabody are often part of the same community. Parents generally know each other. Parents will usually recognize and great each other e.g. in stores across town even if they or their kids don't belong to the same playgroup. The playground is a real community center.

Birthdays only have specific kids invited. The parent I spoke to was unaware of class-wide or grade-wide birthday parties. 

### How much time do parents spend in schools? How often do they come during pick up/drop-off?

Parents occasionally spend some time in classrooms, but not a lot. They do spend a lot of time interacting before and after school, walking kids to school together, walking kids home together, or with kids playing in the playground.

### What’s the main channel of communication among parents (mailing list, forum, face-to-face?)

Mostly of the interaction is face-to-face. Each classroom has a parent mailing list set up by room parents, but classroom-wide discussions are rare. Some moms have text groups for kids friends. 

### What’s the role of the PTO? What does it do? How many active parents in the PTO? 

It's role is to raise money for school needs. They have fundraisers and events, t-shirt sales, bake sales, and similar. For example, when the school organizes a student art show, the Friends organization will sell t-shirts.

### Do all the classes have room parents? Who is in charge of planning classroom events?

Each classroom has 1-2 room parents. Involvement depends on the classroom and the specific room parent, but it's usually limited. All will make a family email list. Some will run some classroom events as well. 

### How integrated is the school? 

The school is well-integrated by racial and socioeconomic status; there really aren't any divides there. The school really celebrates diversity; when you enter the school, there are flags of all the countries kids are from. The kids do tend to segregate by gender starting around second grade: boys will go off and play kickball while girls will do something else.
