## General

Amigos is a K-8 school based on a two-way Spanish immersion program. The school tends to be oversubscribed. Paid lunch students without priority points have low odds of making it in (maybe 20-25% in prior years). Free/reduced lunch students without priority points have a 50/50 shot. Students with language priority points generally do make it in. We have not yet interviewed an Amigos parent.
