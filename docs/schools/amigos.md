## General

Amigos is a K-8 school based on a two-way Spanish immersion program. The school tends to be oversubscribed. Paid lunch students without priority points have low odds of making it in (maybe 20-25% in the year we looked at in detail, but there can be significant variation from year to year). Free/reduced lunch students without priority points have a 50/50 shot. Students with language priority points generally do make it in. 

### What's to like?

## General

### What do most parents say they like the most about your school?

* **The two-way immersion model with Spanish and English is unique.** The school has a long history with immersion and has one of the most mature and robust models for how the bilingual program is structured.
* **It's K-8**. Evidence is kids need 8-10 years of consistent, substantial language exposure in both languages to become biliterate, so this is fitting for an immersion program. More broadly, many parents prefer the K-8 model since it allows, for example, younger and older kids to act as reading buddies and similar synergies. 

*Editor's note: We discussed the immersion component in some depth. The school appears to effectively apply evidence-based best practices to how immersion is structured. I moved this discussion into an Amigos-specific question about immersion models below.*

### Are most families from the neighborhood or spread throughout Cambridge?

Most families are spread throughout Cambridge since Amigos doesn't have neighborhood priority. Instead there is priority for kids who pass a Spanish language exam. 

### What are the afterschool options like?

* The Amigos Community School is probably the largest in the district. It has a very robust set of programs, including in higher grades. It's very popular JK-5. Most kids want to do this program since their friends are in it. It used to be JK-8, but by city policy, it's no longer available in middle school. 
* There is also free-to-the-parents before-school program, supported by Friends of Amigos, which starts at 7:30 am (drawing, coloring, etc.). Starting around 8 am, older kids can also play in the playground or gym.

*Note: Many schools tend to have two programs: a city-run one consisting of fluid play and homework help and Community Schools consisting of a-la-carte courses. The parent I spoke to made a strong argument about how a larger, primary program was a better model. It allows for a greater diversity of classes, as well as for friends from school classes to be together in the same program. Of course, kids can always bus to other afterschool programs as well.*

### How is conflict resolved if there is bullying or harassment?

There is a formal policy under state law where parents fill out a form and the school responds. In applying this policy, the school must balance lines between teasing and bullying, which is sometimes challenging. The current principal brought in a socioemotional development curriculum, with a strong anti-bullying component. This was missing in previous years. The program seems effective -- the numbers on reported incidents of bullying have plummeted over the past two years as a result. 

If there are cases of bullying, usually there's an underlying cause at home. The school works very hard to link all involved parties to appropriate resources, both inside and outside of school (e.g. social worker). The school is very proactive in linking families with outside resources.

The parent described an example where in recess, 4th and 5th grade kids were forming in cliques, excluding other kids. Although this was not bullying, it was antisocial. The principal and gym teacher worked together such those kids started doing community-building activities in Dana Park once a week.

*Editor's note: Parents at other schools which have similar socioemotional development reported virtually no bullying; see the Cambridgeport interview. They appear to work very well in practice. Amigos implemented this program somewhat later than other schools, but based on our discussion, it seems to be functioning well.*

### How diverse is the school staff?

A large percentage of teachers are underrepresented minorities -- especially Latino. The school has more African American teachers than many schools in the district as well. There is a reasonable number of male teachers, although nowhere close to 50/50.

*Editor's note: We spoke at some length about the issue of diversity of both teachers and students. By state statistics of student body, Amigos is the least diverse school in the district, with a split between white and Hispanic and limited representation from any other groups represented (see chart at the bottom of this page). However, this chart misses some of the nuance. For example, there is a large number of people from Spanish-speaking Caribbean countries who are at least in part of African descent but who identify as Hispanic or mixed-race. In our discussion, the school sounded equally diverse; just with different demographics.*

### How happy are families about the school, generally speaking? Any reasons for leaving? What are the most common problems parents give about your school?

The number one reason for leaving is that parents priced out of Cambridge, followed by employment reasons or returning to a home country abroad. One was home-schooled for religious reasons.

### Tips for new families

It's very easy -- especially for families who don't speak any Spanish -- to feel that Amigos isn't appropriate when they first start school. Stick it out -- the evidence is that kids come out bilingual and biliterate.

For Spanish speaking families who are hopeful their children will learn English, don’t be afraid of the 80/20 Spanish/English model in the early grades. The evidence shows that kids who come in as Spanish speakers leave very strong in both languages without losing or demeaning their culture.

*Editor's note: By both district statistics for Amigos, to the extent one trusts test scores (which the editor has analyzed in-depth and doesn't trust) and research studies on bilingual programs more broadly (which the editor has read in-depth and does trust), kids tend to come out ahead in both languages as well as other subjects by around 3rd grade.*

## Academics

### What is the education model for the two-way immersion program?

* Grades JK-2: 80% Spanish, 20% English. Kids are in a single classroom, so when Spanish is used and when English is used tends to be pretty fluid. That gets all kids up to good proficiency before hard-core academics.
* Grade 3-5: The school moves to 50/50, with math split 50/50, science in Spanish, social studies in English, Spanish language arts in Spanish, and ELA in English. Students swap languages at lunchtime. Every other week, morning is English, and every other week, afternoon is English. Each grade is taught by 2 teachers - one in English and one in Spanish.
* In 6th-8th grade, the language is by subject. Social studies and Spanish language arts are in Spanish. Science, English Language Arts, and math are taught in English.

Specials like art, music, and computers are a mix of Spanish and English, and gym is all English. Kids also tend to favor English during recess and lunch.

Of course, this model is evolving. The choice of language in part depends on the set of teachers in the school, and the school is continuing to focus on expanding the Spanish-speaking staff. By the time current JK/K students hit 6-8, if the school is still on the same trajectory, likely a few more courses will be in Spanish.

### How do you differentiate instruction by student?  How are advanced learners handled (a few grade levels ahead)?  Help for kids that are struggling/need help? How about special needs students (e.g. autism, dyslexia, etc.)?  How common is it for students outside of the mainstream (in either direction) to transfer out of the school? How about different student interests? For example, if one student is very interested in biology, another in social justice, and a third in drawing…

* Amigos is trying to move away from leveled classes, including in middle school. The school believes that pathways are not a great model -- many kids need acceleration in some areas and remediation in others -- and pathways can't differentiate by topic.
* For advanced learners, the school has a philosophy of enrichment rather than acceleration. The parent I spoke to gave an example of a puzzle involving describing the arrangement and pattern of seven dots, which could involve anything from counting dots to geometric descriptions to more complex mathematical formulations. Problems like that can reach students across many levels. 
* The school does math clinics once a week, where kids are grouped a bit more by level. Each group works on something which is particularly challenging for that group. Some clinics have historically been multi-grade, although the parent wasn't sure this was still the case. A lot of these are things kids perceive of as games or puzzles.
* The school does guided reading groups with a teacher at all elementary grade levels. Kids at different levels work on different things in small groups.
* Kids who are struggling may work with a specialist to catch up.
* All of these groupings are dynamic. For example, some special needs students might have a hard time with some operations with numbers but be very good with geometry.
* Adding a layer of Spanish to academics adds challenge to advanced learners as well.

The parent walked through an anecdote to explain how this worked: By the end of kindergarten, all kids are assessed based on state standards (which is done by the school, not the state). One child was reading on grade level in English but not in Spanish. The child was pulled out for extra Spanish reading instruction, and six months later, caught up. The child was ahead in mathematics, so the pull-out was scheduled during the child's math class so the child wouldn't miss either more reading practice or the fun subjects which build creativity, socioemotional development, and attitudes towards school..

*Editor's note: A growing number of schools avoid pull-outs during MCAS-tested subjects and pull kids out during art, music, gym, and other fun class. The Amigos model seemed more thoughtful.*

For special interests, there is less room for elective-type work than many other schools due to the time required for multilingual instruction. In early grades, there is an hour and a half of choice time. There are several stations set up and kids pick which one they go to. These tend to be themed and kids have a lot of input on the theme of the center (although teachers also have input since this is how they cover a lot of academics). There might be a block station where there are math challenges set up with those blocks. The teachers try to support Spanish interactions during that time. Kids are also pulled into small-group reading instruction during choice time (so might see an hour and ten minutes of choice time, and 20 minutes of small-group reading instruction). This choice time is maintained through 1st grade, although with less time, and is gone by 2nd grade.

The vast majority of books and readings are chosen jointly by the student and the teacher. There is a lot of room for kids to pick reading topics they're interested in. The parent I spoke to has a child very interested in sports who read many books like biographies of baseball players (and, of course, many books on other topics of interest).

There is a strong before school math Olympiad program (4/5th grade and 6th-8th grade), and the math there tends to be challenging. Kids consider both the math clinics and the math Olympiad to be very fun. Most of the kids who sign up tend to be on grade level or ahead in math, but a few kids who are behind do it as well and enjoy it. The biggest challenge is that some kids live far away so logistics of these programs are hard. The school tries to set up carpools to support them which helps but isn't always adequate.

### Aside from the math, english, science, and social studies, what does the class day include? What are the music, arts, world language, etc. programs.

* Music once a week
* Art once a week
* PE twice a week
* Computers once a week (at least in later grades)
* Library once a week
* Gardening specials (CitySprouts). CitySprouts has a fair bit of parent involvement and projects go beyond just gardening (e.g. pressing apples for cider)

### How is the day broken down on academic versus non-academic time? How much recess is there? How much do kids play otherwise? 

JK-1 has recess twice a day. 2nd grade and above has one recess per day. On Friday, students may earn a second recess. 

### How academically intense are the programs in grades 3-5?

The program is fairly academically intense, and the school tends to do very well on standardized tests.

### Is there homework, and how much in each grade?

Amigos is a school which requires homework starting around first grade. It's not an insurmountable amount, but the philosophy is that if you're learning in two languages, you can't just be exposed to school 6 hours a day.

Homework in the younger grades (1-2) consists of a packet with one page per night to complete in addition to reading or being read to. In the older grades homework consists of 30 minutes per night of reading, a small math packet each week, and a small amount of writing about what kids read. 

### What role does MCAS play in the school and in curriculum design? What role does the Common Core play?

The school very much does not teach to the test or do test prep. Kids see a sample test beforehand as a way to see the format, but it doesn't drive what the school does. Amigos does follow Massachusetts state frameworks and curriculum but the principal emphasizes that teachers should focus on high quality learning and not test prep.

High test scores are important to the school to the extent that Amigos believes that if it keeps them high, it provides a level of flexibility to implement the two-way immersion program without state interference. Hence, the program tends to be pretty rigorous, follows Common Core standards, but is not test-focused.

### What modes of instruction are dominant (e.g. lecture, projects, groupwork, etc.)

Groupwork is dominant. There is an emphasis that teachers should not be lecturing -- that's not an evidence-based way of learning. Every grade level also has at least one major project (often two) which spans multiple major subject areas. The parent walked me through several projects (of course, these vary year-to-year):

* JK/K: Each class did a different country (four countries total). Each child spoke a sentence or two about that country (one about geography, one about people, etc.), also with a fiesta.
* First grade: The kids did a project on Antarctica in English which bridged reading/writing/science/art, and one on tropical forests in Spanish which bridged science/reading/writing/music. Each kid became an expert on one animal.
* Third grade: "Wax museum." Each child researched a Massachusetts historical figure, dressed up as them, made a poster about them, and gave a short speech in character. 

But the predominant model is groupwork, not project-based.

## Family Engagement

### Are parents welcome in classrooms? In the library?

This is teacher-dependent, but in most classrooms, parents are welcome. There are repeated invitations every year for parents to come in and volunteer in classrooms. For example:
* The week before we spoke, one of the parents' teachers wanted parents to come in and do different science experiments with kids in rotation. There were lab stations set up with five stations, 4 kids per station, with stations manned by the teacher, the teacher's aide, and three parents. All this was done in Spanish.
* In kindergarten, each parent is invited to share something about kids cultural heritage. This is usually done around the winter, so many families talk about holiday traditions. 
* Parents are surveyed if they have expertise they would like to share. 

The school aims for 100% parent participation in school, even if just by showing up for a parent-teacher conference. Part of this is breaking down cultural barriers. Some parents feel like coming into the school is something to do only if there is a problem. 

### Does the school act as a community center? For example, do parents tend to organize birthday parties and other parent events at the school or somewhere else?

The school is very welcoming to parent-run activities. Parents run extracurriculars before school. There is a family Friday night soccer run by the community school and open to the wider community. One of the challenges is there are 400 students in one of the smallest buildings in the district. The school has one of the lowest square footage per student. Sixth to eight grade afterschool disappeared due to lack of space. Doing something 4 pm during afterschool might be impossible. And things like birthday parties tend to be done elsewhere. 

The school organizes random events as well:

* "Library night" for kindergartners and their parents where kids came in their pajamas
* "Math game night" for older grades
* Art gallery show. Each child had at least one piece of art displayed
* Science gallery
* Kindergarten does a cantata three times per year (sing for parents and do a breakfast). Hosted at the Pentecostal church which has enough room.
* Multicultural night
* Several community schools showcases
* Several potlucks
* Family grade-level breakfasts

### What's communications with parents like (mailings, parent-teacher conferences, etc.)?

* Principal and vice-principal greet parents as they come in for pick-up/drop-off. Lots of room for informal conversation
* Principal sends out a weekly newsletter Friday afternoon
* Two parent-teacher conferences per year
* A lot of this varies by teacher. Some teachers send a weekly newsletter, some don't (just "remember to wear school t-shirt for assembly" or "here's a permission slip")
* All teachers do email and backpack express
* 3-5 emails per week from family liaison about community events
* Amigos has a new SMS system

### What’s the role of the school council? How often does the school council vote? How many members of the community typically attend meetings? Teacher council? How involved is the community in decision-making?

The school council meets once a month for the ten months of the school year, 6-8 pm. There is free babysitting during the meetings so more parents can come. It's well-advertised. School council members and principal pick topics they hear community wants to talk about. Sometimes external experts are invited (e.g. architect talked about playground design, or expert on social-emotional learning). Almost all have non-council members. Typical attendance is 3-6 parents beyond the 12 school council members, but when a more interesting topic comes up, some are as large as 50 people. The council has about an equal number of parents and teachers.

There is a portion of the meeting where parents can ask for input on any topic they want. Some of those then are added to the agenda for the next meeting, and sometimes they're covered.

It's less of a voting body and more of a discussion/consensus body in how it functions, but that said, parent input feeds closely into things like the school improvement plan. Technically, there is an official vote at least once a month to approve the minutes (although this is just a rubber stamp).

At Amigos, the school council functions more like a traditional PTO than the Friends of Amigos.

### How transparent is the school?

Very. Parents have asked for data and the school was forthcoming with it. The principal goes out to get data parents ask for and has an open-door policy. 

## Community

### How friendly is the community? Do most parents know each other? How do the parents interact? What’s the best way to get to know other parents? Do families generally invite the whole class to birthday parties? How often do kids have playdates with classmates?

A lot of this varies by class and by parent. In one class, the room parents planned 2-3 picnics at Dana Park. The parent I spoke with had two kids. One was in a class where most kids would invite whole class to birthday parties, and the other in a class where kids mostly invited friends.

### How much time do parents spend in schools? How often do they come during pick-up/drop-off?

A lot of kids bus -- the school has five school buses which are mostly full (out of 400 kids total). There is a sizable number of parents who drop of and pick up kids from school and talk while kids play in the playground. There is also a lot of socializing in afterschool pickup. 

### What’s the main channel of communication among parents (mailing list, forum, face-to-face?)

Room parents put together email lists, although a few parents opt-out. Room parents regularly email those lists with reminders of e.g. field trips, pajama day, etc. School-wide, there is a very active Yahoo group. Newly admitted parents are strongly encouraged to be on it at incoming parents events. There are also grade-level listservs, although those are less used (they're used for things like snack rotations, school supply rotations, etc. -- at most schools, parents help keep the school supplied). 

### What’s the role of the PTO? What does it do? How many active parents in the PTO? 

*Editor's note: We had an extended discussion about how the Friends groups aren't technically PTOs (there are no teachers), but I'll keep using the term since it's familiar to incoming parents.*

The Friends of Amigos (FOA) fund-raises and organizes events. A major element of this is a community who does fundraising marathons for the school ("The Flash"), but there are other types of fundraising as well for less athletic parents. FOA responsibilities include:

* Three major community events, one in the fall, one in the winter, one in the spring
* Eighth grade trip to New York, focused on immigration to NY. Significant fundraising to get to 100% participation (including kids babysitting, shoveling snow, raking leaves)
* Funds for several field trips

Most of the roles of a traditional PTO are handled by the school council.

### Do all the classes have room parents? Who is in charge of planning classroom events?

Yes. There is an average of 4-5 room parents per class, often one lead and several supporting. Whether room parents or teachers organize classroom events varies by classroom. Room parents also organize rotations for school supplies and snacks, collect teacher holiday gifts and end-of-year gifts. There is also a kindergarten graduation organized by room parents.

The room parents are grade-wide starting in 1st grade.

### How integrated is the school? 

The school stresses cultural competency more so than the district and bi-cultural literacy as part of the education, and no racial group is in the majority, so the kids are well-integrated by race, socioeconomic status, and native language, including in out-of-school playgroups. They do segregate by gender. 

*Editor's note: Amigos has been one of the more controversial schools in the district. By any metric (including ones like test scores), it is an excellent school, and by many, the top in the district. It has always been strongly oversubscribed. However, there were a number of negative playground rumors about the school as well -- lack of diversity, poor handling of special-needs students, lack of transparency, a large achievement gap, ill-will with the district administration, and issues with school culture. As I've learned more about the school, both from this interview and other conversations, it became obvious that while at least some of these issues were grounded in reality many years ago, the school has changed dramatically since. The school recently hired a new principal who proactively and effectively addressed most of the remaining issues.*

*There is still a significant achievement gap -- one of the largest in the district -- although an odd one. In the absolute, low-SES students still perform on-par with or outperform low-SES students in most other CPSD schools; however, the high-SES students just outperform the high-SES students from other schools by a much bigger margin, leading to a significant gap. The measures here are extremely noisy and inaccurate. Even issues with validity of test data aside, the MCAS data lumps immigrant students from poor countries, students from housing projects with historic African American communities, and children of graduate students into the same "low-SES" category. In practice, these groups are all quite different. Amigos, by its structure, has more immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries, and Amigos low-SES students are from different cultural and educational backgrounds than those from other schools. And, as the parent I spoke to pointed out, for individual schools, the data sets are small enough that the error bars are often too large to generalize this way. On the whole, it's difficult to make accurate statements here without qualitative observation. But the parent I spoke with described the process the school was taking to address the achievement gap in some depth, and said that leading indicators show that the achievement gap is being effectively addressed by the new principal. Of course, kids stay in the school for a decade, and learning takes time, so it takes time for measures like MCAS scores to catch up to changes in instruction.*
