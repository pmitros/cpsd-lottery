Cambridgeport is a school in the MIT-Harvard area. The MIT area schools tend to be undersubscribed, while as one moves towards Harvard and northwest Cambridge, schools get oversubscribed. Cambridgeport is at the edge. Past years, most parent who listed Cambridgeport first made it in even with no priority points (>95% odds, but not guaranteed). The school uses a looping model, where kids stay with teachers for two years in a row.

## General

###Q. What's great about our school?

* Its community
* The inclusiveness of the school, which starts with the principal of the school who literally knows the name of every kid in the school. It's an open, caring environment. 

###Q. Are most families from the neighborhood or spread throughout Cambridge?

Probably most are from the area, but many are from other parts of Cambridge as well. 

###Q. What are the afterschool options like?  What do most people do for afterschool?  How do they like it?

There are two options:

* CAPI (Cambridgeport Afterschool Program, Inc) is more of supervised homework and playtime. The kids get some playground time, some quiet time for homework or reading, some more playtime indoors. 
* Elm St. Community School offers an array of classes and play programs. They've had martial arts, chess club, Lego club, art classes, music lessons, and all sort of other things.

###Q. How is conflict resolved if there is bullying or harassment?

The school has a culture of respect. Bullying is not socially acceptable, and you don't gain status by being a bully, so it doesn't happen much. It's very impressive. When it does happen, its managed rapidly and comprehensively. It starts with the teacher and moves up as necessary. 

Three families who whose kids were bullied came here, and they've been ecstatic. 

###Q. How diverse is the school staff?

Teachers are mostly white women. The administration is pretty diverse. 

###Q. How happy are families about the school, generally speaking? Any tension or reason for leaving?

Families are very happy. Not a lot of people leave Cambridgeport by choice; it's been a refuge for kids unhappy at other schools. For most people who are leaving, Cambridgeport is one of the things they will miss most. 

###Q. Any tips for new families to make the most of it?

Be involved. It's a great program and a great community. Get engaged early. Meet the community. It's a strong and protective community. 

## Academics
### How do you differentiate instruction by student?  How are advanced learners handled (a few grade levels ahead)?  Help for kids that are struggling/need help? How about special needs students (e.g. autism, dyslexia, etc.)?  How common is it for students outside of the mainstream (in either direction) to transfer out of the school?  How about different student interests? For example, if one student is very interested in biology, another in social justice, and a third in drawing…

It varies teacher by teacher. Most teachers are younger, energetic, and try very hard. The great majority are very happy to accommodate advanced kids, but some teachers give it minimal service.

Advanced learners don't have set-asides but the school's major academic emphasis is critical thinking and writing, not memorization and standardized homework forms. Because of that, there are avenues for high-performing kids to go as deep as they want to into specific subject matter. By focusing on that, meeting the needs of diverse students becomes a natural thing. There is a curriculum night (home-school partnership night) where everyone is encouraged to meet the teachers and learn the curriculum, and the range of levels of students comes out in that. 

*Editor's note: In many schools, you will see things which vary by teacher. In most cases, that works better than comprehensive policy; on the whole, empowered teachers do better than systems which try to force things. On the other hand, CALA parents have indicated issues specifically around math instruction for advanced learners in all schools in the district, including Cambridgeport.*

There are special needs teachers, but the parent I spoke to didn't know much about special needs beyond having seen students taken out of class for 1:1 time for services. That's a standard state-mandated district framework. He did comment that some specific needs may be better met at schools with programs targeting those needs. Graham and Parks has a program for dyslexia. FMA has one for autism. He had seen kids transfer to those programs, but he did see other kids stay at Cambridgeport as well. He wasn't really familiar with the reasons there. 

### Aside from the math, English, science, and social studies, what does the class day include? What are the music, arts, world language, etc. programs.

Music, art, technology, library sciences. The art teacher is fantastic. The librarian and technology teacher do internet safety courses -- how do you identify real information versus fake information. A lot of this comes back to the critical thinking skills. Which of these is an opinion and which is a source of news? That goes into the critical thinking curriculum.

### How is the day broken down on academic versus non-academic time? How much recess is there? How much do kids play otherwise?

More lunch and more recess than other schools by about 5 minutes. The principal lengthened these periods as much as she could within district and state regulations.

### How academically intense are the programs in grades 3-5?

It is based on the kid, but for the most part, they're pretty intense, especially by grade 5. The teachers are very focused on preparing students for middle school. Fifth grade is exempted from no homework policy to start developing homework habits.

### Is there homework, and how much in each grade?

There is a no homework by policy, but kids are supposed to read or be read to every night. In addition, although there are no worksheets or assignments, kids are expected to do writing and math five times a week. That's free-form -- kids can do whatever families want, and not necessarily aligned to what's happening in the classroom. For example, the child of the parent I spoke to was making a graphic novel. 

### What role does MCAS play in the school and in curriculum design? What role does the Common Core play?

Both act as skeletal framework within which the teachers try to be as creative as possible. Cambridgeport was originally a project-based school -- each topic was tied into a four-week project. The school is subject to the exams and Common Core, much like everyone else, so it moved away from that, but the teaching is still focused around critical thinking and writing.

With math, there is still a lot of memorization out of necessity (e.g. multiplication tables), but to the degree to which it's possible, teachers strive to not teach to the test. 

### What modes of instruction are dominant (e.g. lecture, projects, group-work, etc.)

Mostly conversational, with the teacher asking critical questions ("Why do you think the Navajo...?"), as well as small group projects. Teachers are called by first name which creates a conversational atmosphere.

*Editor's note: I picked up that 'conversational' in this context meant a whole-class format. Essentially, a lecture, but with a lot of the talking by students. In research studies, that comes out slightly ahead of lecture, but not anywhere close to students having those same conversations in small groups or otherwise doing things. On the other hand, that's pretty standard district-wide.*

## Family Engagement 
### What's communications with parents like (mailings, parent-teacher conferences, etc.)?

* Weekly email from the principal.
* Monthly emails from the PTO.
* They're trying to get rid of papers in the backpack, but a lot goes out that way.
* A lot of the teachers do weekly emails too about what teachers are doing (not a requirement).
* Katie, the principal, is also in front of her office every morning, so a lot of 1:1 conversation at drop-off and pick-up. 

### Are parents welcome in classrooms? In the library?

There is no policy. Most teachers are very welcoming of it, but not all. For the most part, it's encouraged. In the current class, all the parents were invited to talk about immigration issues in one classroom. One parent taught poetry classes. Etc. So a fair number of parents actively engaged with the school.

### Does the school act as a community center? For example, do parents tend to organize birthday parties and other parent events at the school or somewhere else?

Parties can happen in the school and sometimes do, but it's not yet common. It is growing; parents weren't aware they had the option.

### What’s the role of the school council? How often does the school council vote? How many members of the community typically attend meetings?  How involved is the community in decision-making?

The parent wasn't sure, but overall, the role was described as declining. Before Common Core, it had a lot more to do with setting policy, but there isn't much leeway now. School council used to be a big deal. Now, with district standardization efforts, it can't change too much.

*Editors note: This seemed to represent a change from the past, rather than an absolute measure. In the conversation, the parent I spoke to had sat on a teacher hiring committee with the principal. That shows a very high level of parent involvement. See also the question about the PTO's role, and compare to other schools.*

### How transparent is the school?

As transparent as any public school could be.

## Community
### How friendly is the community? Do most parents know each other? How do the parents interact? What’s the best way to get to know other parents? Do families generally invite the whole class to birthday parties? How often do kids have play-dates with classmates?

It starts very early with potlucks and playground dates for incoming kindergartens. Teachers are encouraged (but not required) to do an even before the start of the school every year. The parent community is generally very strong; parents do get a long. A lot of parents hang out on the playground afterschool. There are parent-only events that are generally well-attended. 

There are, of course, groups of parents or kids who get along or don't, but the key watchword is community. The start of school potluck had hundreds of people. They try very hard to foster that, and it's generally very successful.

For portfolio days, there's a real emphasis on "don't just talk to your own child, go around and talk to other kids." Parents who mind not know what to talk about are given a guide with examples of questions to ask other kids. It helps. Kids know each other kids' parents. People take this seriously. You see what your kids friends are doing. That mixing is core to the school. 

### How much time do parents spend in schools? How often do they come during pick up/drop-off?

Many parents hang out at pick-up/drop-off, others are racing to meetings. 

### What’s the main channel of communication among parents (mailing list, forum, face-to-face?)

Room parents create classroom mailing list. It depend on the class, but those tend to get mailings a couple of times a month. Some do a lot more (one class the parent I spoke to was in had a super-active list), and some did less. 

### What’s the role of the PTO? What does it do? How many active parents in the PTO? 

The PTO provide curriculum support
* Every teacher gets a $250 grant to spend on anything
* New teachers or people changing specialties get an additional $250 to help set up a classroom
* The PTO fully fund a crazy eights math club, so there's a free math-focused afterschool option
* The PTO provides field trip funding support (so families who can't afford to pay don't have to keep kids home or decide between that and eating)
* The PTO provide arts programs

*Editor's note: These seem well-targeted to district needs. As a baseline, every teacher receives around $20 per student from the district to spend on student materials; the rest, many teachers pay out-of-pocket. District-wide, the gap in learning between low-SES and high-SES is largely attributable to afterschool and summer learning; wealthier kids have about double the learning time of poorer kids. The crazy eights targets that. And so on.*

### Do all the classes have room parents? Who is in charge of planning classroom events?

All classrooms have room parents. They organize events. The family liaison organizes monthly room parent meetings.

### How integrated is the school? 

As much as socially possible, there is an absence of cliques. It's a very diverse school. It's hard for a single group to emerge; it's hard to create a popular group. There's a lot of mixing.

The social justice is about elevating, not segregating and labeling. One project the parent I spoke to saw was about the American Revolution. In it, students discussed stories from the Revolution from the perspectives different people. Some kids picked generals, and others looked at slaves or freed slaves. There were nuanced interactions between different groups which the kids got a very real sense of.
