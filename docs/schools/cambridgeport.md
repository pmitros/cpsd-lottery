Cambridgeport is a school in the MIT-Harvard area. The MIT area schools tend to be undersubscribed, while as one moves towards Harvard and northwest Cambridge, schools get oversubscribed. Most years, if you list Cambridgeport first, you'll get in even with no priority points (>95% odds, although not guaranteed).
