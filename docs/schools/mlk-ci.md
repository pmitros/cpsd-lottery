Please see the [**Dr. MLK**](/#mlk) page. It talks about both programs.

However, be aware MLK Chinese Immersion expects to have zero openings for children without siblings in the fall of 2018. 

*Disclaimer: A parent wrote that there may be openings for a small number of students in the lottery, depending on how [school committee motions](http://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/school_committee/minutes/11-21-17_SC_Meeting_Minutes.pdf) 17-271, 17-246, and SES-balancing play together. There are more internal transfers and siblings than there are spots for the fall of 2018 and 17-271 gives the district administration broad discretion to place both groups ahead of everyone else. However, the district administration is also charged with SES balancing and a cap on the size of the kindergarten class. In fact, there may be a couple of slots left over for very specific groups depending on how the administration interprets the interplay of these policies. That is beyond the scope of this website; if you are in one of those groups, we recommend discussing with the Family Resource Center.*
