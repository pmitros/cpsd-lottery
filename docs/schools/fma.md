## General

### What do most parents say they like the most about your school?

Robin Harris, the principal, cares about every student, and bends over backwards to help them. 

### Are most families from the neighborhood or spread throughout Cambridge?

There is a concentration of kids from the Port neighborhood, but kids come from all around Cambridge too.

### What are the afterschool options like?

The school has a Community School. A group of the kids is also walked over to the [Community Art Center Programs](http://www.communityartcenter.org/sacc) nearby. 

### How is conflict resolved if there is bullying or harassment?

The school has a peace couch and procedures, but it's handled differently in different contexts. Bullying in classrooms and in playground will have uneven responses sometimes. The school is working towards a more focused strategy, inlcuding a character-building curriculum as well as [a zones of regulation](https://www.socialthinking.com/Products/Zones%20of%20Regulation) curriculum in later grades, where students learn to label feelings with colors and develop coping strategies for different zones. It's still somewhat uneven in application. 

### How diverse is the school staff? 

The administration is mostly or all African American. The teachers are mostly white women. 

### How happy are families about the school, generally speaking? Any reasons for leaving? What are the most common problems parents give about your school?

Families are generally quite happy. In terms of reasons for leaving, there is pretty good data. There was a perception that many students left FMA one year, and families involved in school leadership asked the principal. The principal came back with statistics. It turned out that it was a misperception -- two high-profile families left so which gave that impression, but kids weren't leaving the school. A few special needs kids left for specific programming. One left for more academic rigor at a charter school. Everyone else left because they were moving. *Editor's note: FMA is pretty special here in two ways. First, this story illustrates how responsive the principal was to parent questions and needs. Second, despite special needs kids leaving, as a rule, the school bends over backwards to keep special needs kids in the school.*

### Tips for new families

Take advantage of Robin's openness. Approach the PTO people. Get into the community. 

## Academics

### How do you differentiate instruction by student?  How are advanced learners handled (a few grade levels ahead)?  Help for kids that are struggling/need help? How about special needs students (e.g. autism, dyslexia, etc.)?  How common is it for students outside of the mainstream (in either direction) to transfer out of the school? How about different student interests? For example, if one student is very interested in biology, another in social justice, and a third in drawing…

Much of this wasn't known to the parents we spoke to (it's more a question for admins), but we did discuss outside interests a bit. There are student clubs which meet once a week. Basketball club. Drawing. Yoga. Kinetic sculptures. Teachers run those.

The schools approach to differeniating is on a teacher-by-teacher basis. Some are excellent, some are less so. 

### Aside from the math, english, science, and social studies, what does the class day include? What are the music, arts, world language, etc. programs.

The school has music, Spanish, physical education, IT, as well as "specials" which students choose.

### How is the day broken down on academic versus non-academic time? How much recess is there? How much do kids play otherwise? 

In theory, there are two recess breaks of maybe 25 minutes (parent I spoke to suggested checking with the school for exact number). In reality, recess is often the first thing cut when something runs over. 

### How academically intense are the programs in grades 3-5?

It's not very intense. Might get some fantastic enrichment with some teachers, less so with others. 

### Is there homework, and how much in each grade?

Yes there is. In 3rd/4th/5th, students are expected to read about 20 minutes per night. Additional homework can take half an hour or more for some of the kids. Quality of homework varies from teacher to teacher. The ELA homework tends to be more thoughtful and differentiated. With math homework, some classes had rote math homework which was often level-inappropriate especially to advanced kids (which leads to kids disliking math class). Others have high-quality homework (in another class, a teacher gave math puzzles which the child loved). The school appears to have some policy where teachers have to give homework including ones who don't want to. 

### What role does MCAS play in the school and in curriculum design? What role does the Common Core play?

Parent I spoke to didn't know. 

### What modes of instruction are dominant (e.g. lecture, projects, groupwork, etc.)

The parent I spoke to wasn't sure and suggested I ask a student, but indicated it was pretty mixed -- a little of everything. 

## Family Engagement

### Are parents welcome in classrooms? In the library?

From a school perspective, very much so, but teachers can put their own limitations there. So for classrooms, it depends more on the teacher than on the school.

*Editor's note: Some schools allow parents in classrooms, and others do not. So it varies by both.*

### Does the school act as a community center? For example, do parents tend to organize birthday parties and other parent events at the school or somewhere else?

Very much so! Haven't heard of anyone hosting a birthday, but there are lots of community meetings there, and the school doesn't charge for that. Parent groups, boyscouts, YPP, etc. host meetings there.

### What's communications with parents like (mailings, parent-teacher conferences, etc.)?

There is a newsletter both on web site and in backpacks. There are regular parent-teacher conference. For upper grades, those conferences include the kids, which is nice. There is sporodic use of the robocalls, which is sometimes a little bit confusing. The PTO sends out emails.

There are many teacher-specific modes of communication as well -- for example, one teacher has a texting list which sends out things like "school photos tomorrow."

### What’s the role of the school council? How often does the school council vote? How many members of the community typically attend meetings? Teacher council? How involved is the community in decision-making?

We call this leadership at FMA. Anyone is invited to come to leadership and input from everyone is welcome (even not members of the core team). This group usually includes the PTO presidents, a few community members, a few teachers, principal, etc. It's mostly a discussion, rather than formal voting. Last time they discussed MCAS scores, some socioemotional issues (reaction to school bullying), school budget (what to do with unallocated money -- the principal requested everyone go away and think about where to spend it), school improvement plan. Basically, the principal solicits feedback on things which are happening in the school and answering questions.

### How transparent is the school?

The community is sometimes a bit defensive. The school has had an undeserved negative reputation for a long time, and as a result parents go out of their way to protect it.

## Community

### How friendly is the community? Do most parents know each other? How do the parents interact? What’s the best way to get to know other parents? Do families generally invite the whole class to birthday parties? How often do kids have playdates with classmates?

The parent I spoke to expressed that the community was very friendly from her perspective, but she advised asking the same questions to parents of other demographics (esp. Haitian parents), where she wasn't sure.

Parents interact at school events, classroom presentations, on the playground afterschool, at pickup, and the best way to get to know parents is to show up and be there. Most parents don't invite whole classrooms to birthdays, but kids do frequently have playdates with classmates. Most parents do not know each other. 

### How much time do parents spend in schools? How often do they come during pick up/drop-off?

Some parents are there every day and hang out there. Others only go to a few parent-teacher conferences.

*Editor's note: Many schools don't let parents hang out there. This sort of community is also a good thing to look for!*

### What’s the main channel of communication among parents (mailing list, forum, face-to-face?)

Face-to-face or texting. 

### What’s the role of the PTO? What does it do? How many active parents in the PTO? 

The PTO focuses on community-building first and fundraising second. The primary goal is to have activities to get parents, teachers, and students together in the first place. If they make money, that's a bonus. For example, next Thursday, all parents are invited to Bertuccis. The success of that will be judged on whether many people from many different demographics are there -- young kids and old kids, moms and dads, different races, teachers/administrators/families, etc. If it makes money too, that's nice.

About 10-12 show up for the meetings, but a pretty deep list of people can be called upon to e.g. bring a dish, set up tables, or do other specific tasks. So there's a small core group, but lots of other parents willing to pitch in.

### Do all the classes have room parents? Who is in charge of planning classroom events?

There are no room parents. Class events are organized by teachers. 

### How integrated is the school? 

There is a strong clustering by gender, but less so by race. School projects are integrated; teachers are very intentional about having group projects in groups sometimes homogenous by ability level and sometimes heterogenous.

### From parents at other schools:
* Amazing **community** - envy of other parents. ;-)
* Amazing **principal** sets the tone for school of working together with families and community
* Weekly **all-school assembly** with agenda put together by the students themselves… all the parents are invited. (Try going to one of those to get a sense of the community.)
* Word on the street "hidden gem".
