Kennedy-Longfellow is a school in East Cambridge, in the Kendall/Lechmere area. It's an older building, with a nice playground and field.

Kennedy-Longfellow is in the MIT area, which has *many* schools and fewer families, so it tends to be very undersubscribed.

## General

### What do most parents say they like the most about your school?

* The openness and the atmosphere.
* The accessiblity of the teachers and family liasion, Nancy Wyse. She's incredibly welcoming, listens a lot, and really tries to help families. She was one of the pionoeers behind backpack program (second school after Tobin) and really goes out of way to help. She also helped start the food market

### Are most families from the neighborhood or spread throughout Cambridge?

Parents come from all over. K-Lo is the Eastern-most school within Cambridge, so it tends to be very undersubscribed, and many families from all over Cambridge are mandatorily assisgned. Many are initially upset at the mandatory assignment, but then very happy with the talent of teachers and the welcoming atmosphere.

There are a lot of kids from MIT and Harvard business school programs who tend to be housed in big apartment buildings close to Kendall or in graduate dormitories. They stay a short time (1-2 years), but bring a lot to the school -- there's an international character to the school. Their kids also tend to be younger.

### What are the afterschool options like?

There are two main programs:

(1) [East End House](http://eastendhouse.org/) is a local community center non-profit. They run a [preschool program](http://eastendhouse.org/programs-and-services/child-care-program) and [an afterschool program](http://eastendhouse.org/programs-and-services/out-school-time-programs). They pick up kids from the building. Unlike most of the afterschool program, East End House is an everyday program; it's open almost all days of the year (school breaks, vacation weeks, early release days, summer program, etc.). It's also a flat rate per month.
(2) As with most schools, there is the a [Community School](http://www.cambridgema.gov/DHSP/programsforkidsandyouth/communityschools/kennedycommunityschool.aspx) with a-la-carte class selections.

### How is conflict resolved if there is bullying or harassment?

The parent I spoke with had only heard of one experience (a friend), where the conflict was resolved through the teacher and the principal who mediated between the families.

### How diverse is the school staff? 

Only a few male teachers -- maybe just two -- gym teacher and kindergarten teacher. Otherwise, there isn't a huge level of diversity, but the school has a shelter English immersion program and the teachers from that program often speak a second language. The teachers have been around a long time -- a number of teachers have been in the school for 20+ years. The principal has been there for 8-10 years as well.

### How happy are families about the school, generally speaking? Any reasons for leaving? What are the most common problems parents give about your school?

The majority of families are quite happy. 

The main reason for leavin is that families move away. Some move to the suburbs due to cost of living in Cambridge. There are also MBA students who stay for 1-2 years and then leave, mostly in younger grades. This might mean that a class starts with 19 kids, but has just a dozen by the end of the year. In older grades, fewer families leave. There were a few cases cases where kids with disciplinary issues or special needs transferred out of the school.

The major criticisms are:

* Parent involvement is limited. Friends of Longfellow is a new group which just incorporated a year ago, and the school council is not very active. 
* The Principal is considered a little bit strict
* The cafeteria is noisy and has horrible acoustics, to the level of bothering some younger students

### Tips for new families

* Talk to Nancy Weiss and keep talking to the teachers. They're amazing. Meet them, talk to them, and keeping talking.

## Academics

### How do you differentiate instruction by student?  How are advanced learners handled (a few grade levels ahead)?  Help for kids that are struggling/need help? How about special needs students (e.g. autism, dyslexia, etc.)?  How common is it for students outside of the mainstream (in either direction) to transfer out of the school? How about different student interests? For example, if one student is very interested in biology, another in social justice, and a third in drawing…

* For kids with disabilities, services offered are amazing. Occupation therapy, speech therapy, physical therapy, academic support person. A few social workers. There aren't specialists for specific disabilities, but there is a lot of support.
* For advanced learners, the parent I spoke to was familiar with one child. Their teacher and assistant teacher have gone out of their way to create sub-groups to work ahead of their grade level and did a good job with that. They work very hard to make sure everyone progresses, no matter the starting point.

### Aside from the math, english, science, and social studies, what does the class day include? What are the music, arts, world language, etc. programs.

* The school has a strong science and technology angle. Five or six years ago the school was awarded a fairly prestigous grant (probably around a million dollars from the Merck family foundation) for technology. Each child is provided with an iPad and each classroom has a smartboard. There's a makerspace where kids go every two weeks. Kids also do computer programming appropriate to their level.
* Upper grades partner with one or more MIT organizations (the parent thought it was the Broad Institute) and students have mentorship from members of the MIT community.

### How is the day broken down on academic versus non-academic time? How much recess is there? How much do kids play otherwise?

* In kindergarten, there's a lot of playtime. Formally, kids go out twice a day, weather permitting, but all the kindergarten classrooms have a door to the playground (or very close), so teachers can step outside as needed if kids need to get the sillies out.
* By grade two, there is only about 15 minutes of recess per day. Lunch is about 25 minutes, so kids often don't have time to finish eating. There isn't much free choice time for the older kids either -- it's mostly on special occasions (birthday) or a few times per week
* There is a lot of diversity in terms of types of teaching, though, with groupwork and similar, so there is some balance; it's not all worksheets and similar.

### How academically intense are the programs in grades 3-5?

The parent I spoke to did not know.

### Is there homework, and how much in each grade?

It varies by teacher, but it doesn't tend to be too much. The parent I spoke to reported that in kindergarten, some teachers give kids sight words to look over, and in second grade, there was an optional weekly math worksheet which a bright student could complete in about ten minutes

### What role does MCAS play in the school and in curriculum design? What role does the Common Core play?

The parent I spoke to did not know, but was aware that it stressed out both the students and the teachers.

### What modes of instruction are dominant (e.g. lecture, projects, groupwork, etc.)

In kindergarten, kids sit 3-4 per table, and do activities with teachers walking around (although mostly not groupwork).

By grade two, there is a combination of group projects (often two students paired together) and creative multistep individual projects. I asked for a few examples:

* Classrooms celebrate Japanese Children's Day. Kids make a fish kite, where they color paper to look like a fish, spray with water, glue it, and write a statement about how they think about themselves.
* The parents described the kids spearheading a pretty elaborate puppetshow supported by the teacher in first grade (building sets and then performing)
* There was an assignment where kids wrote a story about something they really loved. They went through a few cycles of editing, and then presented that at a student showcase in mid-May (paired with an international potluck)

## Family Engagement

### Are parents welcome in classrooms? In the library?

* It depends on the teacher, but generally, very welcome to volunteer or observe in classrooms. The parent I spoke to described several instances.
* There are also specific calls for volunteers (e.g. book fairs, making book marks, helping with food fair, etc.)

It's a welcoming school.

### Does the school act as a community center? For example, do parents tend to organize birthday parties and other parent events at the school or somewhere else?

No it doesn't. There aren't really any parent-lead activities in the schools.

### What's communications with parents like (mailings, parent-teacher conferences, etc.)?

* The teachers try to send a weekly report (sometimes paper, sometimes email).
* Family liason sends a lot of information in paper form and often by email (perhaps once a week)
* Robocalls for important events which require parents to come to school

### What’s the role of the school council? How often does the school council vote? How many members of the community typically attend meetings? Teacher council? How involved is the community in decision-making?

It's not very healthy; one year there were no meetings. Another year, they were intermittent. This year, it's been meeting once a month. Typically attending are:

* 1 person from East End House
* President of Cambridge Business Association
* 3-4 teachers
* 3-4 parents
* Principal
* Family liasion

A lot of time is devoted to organizing "Family Fun Festival" and the international potluck. The teachers drive a lot of these events so there is not much need for parent help. It's not very involved in curriculum or budget. There was a little bit of discussion of external donations and partnerships, but overall, the goals of the school council are not very well-defined.

### How transparent is the school?

No negative experiences, but haven't faced a major problem yet. Teachers are the first go-to person and tend to be quite responsive.

## Community

### How friendly is the community? Do most parents know each other? How do the parents interact? What’s the best way to get to know other parents? Do families generally invite the whole class to birthday parties? How often do kids have playdates with classmates?

The parents who come to school to pick up their children are very interactive and tend to know each other. Many hang out in the playground afterschool. The families whose kids take the bus are much less visible.

Whole-class invitations are uncommon in early grades because there isn't really contact information for other parents. You might send an invitation in a backpack. As kids get older, they can take more initiative to invite friends, so there are more whole-class birthday parties.

### How much time do parents spend in schools? How often do they come during pick-up/drop-off?

* 50 or more parents who pick up right at the school each day. It's a really crowded lobby (or for kindergarten, parents pick up from classrooms)
* The school is open to parents volunteering in classrooms, but it's not too common. Classrooms might have a volunteer once a week for some specific activity, but not so much for the whole day
* Teachers are always looking for volunteers for field trips
* That said, parents are very welcome to sit/stay/observe classes too

### What’s the main channel of communication among parents (mailing list, forum, face-to-face?)

* None of that. There really isn't parent-to-parent communication more broadly. There are no group lists. Individual parents will email or SMS to set up individual playdates

### What’s the role of the PTO? What does it do? How many active parents in the PTO? 

The organization is new, and the role is still being defined. Broadly, it is planning to raise money to support the school: trying to fund projects teachers would like to do, support kids who can't pay for field trips. There are about 6-8 families involved, and it has only about $500.

### Do all the classes have room parents? Who is in charge of planning classroom events?

Room parents are not very common. 

### How integrated is the school? 

It's very integrated. Kids play across all boundaries, which is awesome.
