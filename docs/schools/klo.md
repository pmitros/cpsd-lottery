Kennedy-Longfellow is a school in East Cambridge, in the Kendall/Lechmere area. It's an older building, with a nice playground and field.

Kennedy-Longfellow is in the MIT area, which has *many* schools and fewer families, so it tends to be pretty undersubscribed.

We have not yet found a parent to interview so we have no information beyond that.
