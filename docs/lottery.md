# Lottery De-Mystified (and re-mystified)

Here's the school choice form. As a first pass, you might just fill in your school choices in order.  Read our write up on [choosing schools](/#choose) if you need help.

## The Gory Details
However, if your goal is to go to an oversubscribed school (see [estimated seat availability data](http://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/departments/administration/frc/2018_Lottery_Projections_DataForWebsite.pdf) ), as many are, it gets a lot more complex.  So, to get into the complexity:

* **Siblings** of kids already in programs will almost always get into those programs first. For example, in the January 2018 lottery, most if not all the remaining spots in Chinese Immersion are expected to be taken by siblings, but that will not be the case starting the following year due to  internal transfer being eliminated. So it's helpful to look at numbers to estimate your odds.

* Next will be kids with **priority points**. These come from passing a language exam for immersion programs, or [proximity](http://cpsd.us/departments/frc/proximity_map_finder) for other schools. For many oversubscribed schools, you are unlikely to get in unless you have at least this level of priority. Back when Graham and Parks was run by Len Solo back in the 70-90s, there was a flood of short leases in the proximity of the school to gain proximity priority points.

* The schools are balanced by **socioeconomic status.** When registering, you're asked to indicated whether you're eligible for free/reduced-price school lunches. If low-SES parents want to go to a school which is better at targeting their students, they have the option of leaving this field blank and being labeled high-SES. High-SES students cannot be labeled low-SES, though.

* The lottery happens twice -- JK and K, if your chid's birthday makes them eligible for JK. If you don't like your JK lottery outcome, you can keep your child in childcare for an extra year, not enroll, and try again for K. If your child is in school for even a day, you lose that option, though.

* If your goal is to go to **FMA** or **Tobin Montessori**, you may consider [the three-year-old lottery](http://www.cpsd.us/departments/frc/registering_for/new_3_year_old) a year earlier. That will give your child priority. For FMA's three-year-old lottery, you may consider BabyU which will give priority into the FMA preschool, Scholar College.  

    Note the three year old lottery is very competitive. 

* If your child doesnâ€™t get into your first choice, the CPSD lottery will not place you in an oversubscribed second or third choice school. You have a few choices here: 

    1. Rate schools honestly. If you don't get into your top choices, at least you'll be on all the waiting lists. 

    2. Place an undersubscribed safety school second. You'll likely get in. 

    3. Place an oversubscribed second and third choice you know you won't get into (Chinese Immersion and Amigos are good choices). This will give you top priority in the wait list for your #1 choice. 

    Which of those choices makes most sense depends on what you care about. If you want a school close by, and there are several, go with #1. If you really want to avoid mandatory assignment, go with #2. If there's a program you really want, go with #3. This decision may also depend on typical waitlist length (for which you can call FRC). 

* **Wait lists** aren't the same. For over-subsbscribed school choices such as the immersion programs, the waitlist for paid lunch families can move glacially slow.  While less over-subscribed programs such as MLK (non-immersion), almost everyone on the waitlist has been able to get in most years.  

* **Wait lists** don't always go in order. For example, for immersion programs, they are cleared trying to maintain a 50/50 balance of native speakers and non-native speakers. Some years, taking the language exam may actually *hurt* your odds of getting in.

* In past years, parents gamed internal transfers (King Open to Ola and MLK to CI). Internal transfers will be unavailable for this lottery.

Yes, parents [can and many would](https://www2.bc.edu/tayfun-sonmez/ChenSonmez-JET06.pdf) use some of the strategies above to improve their chance in the lottery.  You can't guarantee placement at a school but you can greatly increase your odds.  What this means is that parents with time and energy to investigate will have a strong advantage over ones without. We find this really unfortuante, and hope by **publicizing** the above, to give more parents the right info so they aren't left behind by the lottery game.  


If gaming concerns you, please write to [the school committee](mailto:SchoolCom@cpsd.us) asking them to switch to [a non-gameable](http://www.columbia.edu/~js1353/pubs/tst-ipco99.pdf) system, as many other districts have; these are also more modern systems and more broadly result in better placements.
(If you'd like to see a worked example for one program, [this page](http://vote.mitros.org/chinese-immersion) describes how the 2017 Chinese Immersion lottery worked. Note that transfers were since eliminated so the flow chart would be (slightly) different today. )
