# Lottery De-Mystified (and re-mystified)

Here's the school choice form

As a first pass, you might just fill in your school choices in order.

# The Gory Details

However, if your goal is to go to an oversubscribed school, as many are, it gets a lot more complex. The CPSD school lottery is gameable. What this means is that parents with MIT Ph.Ds have a strong advantage over ones without (if gaming concerns you, please write to [the school committee](mailto:SchoolCom@cpsd.us) asking them to switch to [a non-gameable](http://www.columbia.edu/~js1353/pubs/tst-ipco99.pdf) system, as many other districts have).

So, to get into the complexity:

* Siblings of kids in programs will almost always get into those programs first. In this fall's lottery, all remaining spots in Chinese Immersion are expected to be taken by siblings. It's helpful to look at numbers to estimate your odds.
* Next will be kids with priority points. These come from passing a language exam for immersion programs, or proximity for other schools. For many oversubscribed schools, you are unlikely to get in unless you have at least this level of priority. When Graham and Parks was run by Len Solo, there was a flood of short leases by one-percenters in the proximity of the school to gain proximity priority points
* The schools are balanced by socioeconomic status. When registering, you're asked to indicated whether you're eligible for free/reduced-price school lunches. If low-SES parents want to go to a school which is better at targeting their students, they have the option of leaving this field blank and being labeled high-SES. High-SES students cannot be labeled low-SES, though.
* The lottery happens twice -- JK and K. If you don't like your JK lottery outcome, you can keep your child in childcare for an extra year, not enroll, and try again for K. If your child is in school for even a day, you lose that option, though.
* If your goal is to go to FMA or Tobin Montessori, you may consider [the three-year-old lottery](http://www.cpsd.us/departments/frc/registering_for/new_3_year_old) a year earlier. That will give your child priority. For FMA's three-year-old lottery, you may consider BabyU which will give priority into the FMA preschool, Scholar College
* The CPSD lottery will not place you in an oversubscribed second or third choice school. You have a few choices here: (1) Place an undersubscribed safety school second. You'll get in. (2) Place an oversubscribed second and third choice you know you won't get into (Chinese Immersion and Amigos are good choices). This will give you top priority in the wait list for your #1 choice. (3) Rate schools honestly. If you don't get into #1, #2, or #3, at least you'll be on all waiting lists. Which of those choices makes most sense depends on what you care about. If you want a school close by, and there are several, go with #3. If you really want to avoid mandatory assignment, go with #1. If there's a program you really want, go with #2. This decision may also depend on typical waitlist length (for which you can call FRC). 
* In past years, parents gamed internal transfers (King Open to Ola and MLK to CI). Internal transfers will be unavailable for this lottery.
* Wait lists don't go in order. For immersion programs, they are cleared trying to maintain a 50/50 balance of native speakers and non-native speakers. Some years, taking the language exam may actually *hurt* your odds of getting in.

If you'd like to see a worked example for one program, [this page](http://vote.mitros.org/chinese-immersion) describes how the 2017 Chinese Immersion lottery worked. Note that transfers were since eliminated.
