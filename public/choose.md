## How to choose a school
Good guide from parents debunking myths around “playground talk” reputation, test scores. 

Take it easy, most parents are very happy with whichever school they end up with. :)
Start with proximity schools
Benefits of knowing other kids in your neighborhood for your kids to have playdates (now) and hang out with (later).
More likely to hang out at school and get to know what’s going on and the other parents.  (Becca: Some of my best friends now are parents from our schools.)
There is no one best school: Different schools for different kids and families.
Visit the schools!  Schedule school tours for schools you’re interested in.
Specialty programs
Music, language, Montessori, etc.

What to do on a school visit
See how classrooms are managed. Do students look actively engaged? Are they doing things? 
See if there are parents or other community members in the school
Look for diversity: students learn better when there’s a variety of them.
And whether integrated?
See how well the school does for students a little outside of the mainstream. Almost all Cambridge schools target the median student well. Talk to teachers about what they do if students are ahead or behind.
Look at grades 3-5. There are much bigger differences between schools as kids get older. Briefly look at middle schools too but realize things may change completely in the next six years.
